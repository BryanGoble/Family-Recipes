title: 'Baja Chicken Quesadillas'
description: "Making a fine quesadilla is easy (just ask your college self—all you needed was a tortilla, whatever cheese you happened to have on hand, and a microwave). Making a great quesadilla, however, requires just a bit more finesse. Take this one, for instance. It’s golden and crispy on the outside (thanks, butter!) and filled with spiced chicken and two kinds of melty cheese. The finishing touches? Spoonfuls of fresh tomato salsa and a drizzle of tangy lime crema. It’s a classic...just a little bit better."
