title: 'Chipotle Chicken and Rice Bowl'
description: "Bowls have gone beyond “having a moment” and officially become a dinnertime staple. And why not? They’re hearty, comforting, and so versatile. This version is packed with delicious (nutritious!) fixings like spiced chicken and toasty, roasted sweet potatoes. They’re served over a bed of scallion-flecked lime rice and topped with fresh salsa and smoky-hot chipotle crema. Yep, this bodacious bowl is sure to satisfy."
