title: Cauliflower Pancetta Mac 'n' Cheese
description: "Normally, we don’t mess with classics like mac ’n’ cheese. But when our chefs suggested adding some cauliflower and pancetta, there was no doubt that we just had to go there. The result? A dish that’s as genre-bending as it is comforting. It’s proof that vegetables and comfort food can coexist in melty, creamy, tender, and porky harmony."

ingredients: ['2 unit Scallions', '10 ounce Cauliflower Florets', '6 ounce Cavatappi Pasta', '2 ounce Pancetta', '1 tablespoon Flour', '1 cup Milk', '1 unit Chicken Stock Concentrate', '½ cup Italian Cheese Blend', '2 teaspoon Olive Oil', '1 tablespoon Butter', ' Salt', ' Pepper']

instructionTitles: ['Roast Cauliflower', 'Cook Pasta', 'Crisp Pancetta', 'Make Cheese Sauce', "Bake Mac 'n' Cheese", 'Plate and Serve']
instructions: ['Wash and dry all produce. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Thinly slice scallions, keeping greens and whites separate. Toss cauliflower on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast in oven until tender, 20-25 minutes.', 'Once water is boiling, add cavatappi to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. Drain.', 'Meanwhile, heat a large pan over medium-high heat (use an ovenproof pan if you have one). Add half the pancetta (use the rest as you like) and scallion whites. Cook, tossing, until crisp and browned at edges, 4-5 minutes. Remove from pan with a slotted spoon, keeping as much oil in pan as possible.', 'Melt 1 TBSP butter in same pan over medium heat. Once melted, add flour and stir constantly until it loses its raw smell, 1-2 minutes. Slowly pour in milk, whisking to combine. Stir in chicken stock concentrate and let simmer until thickened, 1-2 minutes. Remove pan from heat, then stir in cheese. Season with salt and pepper.', 'Stir cavatappi, pancetta mixture, and ¾ of the cauliflower into sauce in pan. Scatter remaining cauliflower over top. Bake in oven until bubbly, 5-7 minutes. > TIP: If your pan is not ovenproof, transfer mixture to a medium, lightly oiled baking dish at this point.', 'Divide mac ’n’ cheese between plates. Garnish with scallion greens and serve.']
