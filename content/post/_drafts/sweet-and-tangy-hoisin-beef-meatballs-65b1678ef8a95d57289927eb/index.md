description: "Our chefs add tons of flavor to tender pork meatballs with a delectable soy glaze swirled with tangy-sweet hoisin sauce that you’ll brush over during the last few minutes of roasting. The meatballs are served over a jumble of roasted sweet potatoes and tender green beans seasoned with ginger and scallion, and sprinkled with nutty, crackly sesame seeds for a hearty, colorful meal that tastes every bit as delectable as it looks."

instructions: ['• Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees (top and middle positions for 4 servings). Lightly oil a baking sheet. Wash and dry produce. • Trim and quarter sweet potato lengthwise; cut into ½-inch-thick pieces. Peel and mince or grate ginger. Trim green beans if necessary. Trim and cut scallions into 1-inch pieces. • In a large bowl, soak breadcrumbs with 2 TBSP water (4 TBSP for 4); let sit until absorbed (you’ll use in the next step).', '• Toss sweet potato, ginger, and sesame seeds on one side of prepared sheet with a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. (For 4 servings, spread out across entire sheet.) Roast on top rack for 5 minutes (you’ll add more to the sheet then). • While sweet potato roasts, to bowl with breadcrumb mixture, add pork*, garlic powder, onion powder, salt (we used ¾ tsp; 1¼ tsp for 4), and pepper and gently mix to combine. • Form into 6 evenly sized meatballs (12 meatballs for 4). Swap in beef for pork.', '• Once sweet potato has roasted 5 minutes, remove sheet from oven. On empty side of sheet, place meatballs. (For 4 servings, add meatballs to a second sheet.) • Carefully toss green beans and scallions with sweet potato. • Return to top rack until meatballs are cooked through, 11 minutes. (For 4, roast meatballs on middle rack and veggies on top rack, swapping positions halfway through.)', '• Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix soy glaze and hoisin until combined.', '• Once veggies and meatballs have cooked 11 minutes, remove sheet from oven. (For 4 servings, leave veggies roasting on middle rack.) • Carefully brush meatballs with hoisin glaze. Return to top rack until glaze is tacky and veggies are tender, 3-5 minutes more.', '• Divide sesame-ginger veggie jumble between shallow bowls; top with hoisin-glazed meatballs. Serve. Ground Beef is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160°.']
