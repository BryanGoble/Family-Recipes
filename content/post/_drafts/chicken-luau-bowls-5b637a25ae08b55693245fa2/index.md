title: 'Chicken Luau Bowls'
description: "Our chefs can’t get enough of pairing chicken with pineapple. One’s savory and one’s sweet, meaning that the duo has some sophisticated contrasts to please the adults while also being plenty fun and familiar for the kids. In these rice bowls, they’re joined by other ingredients that give the whole dish a tropical feel, like ginger, honey butter carrots, and a soy-sauce-based glaze."

Cover with plastic wrap, poke a few holes in it, and set aside.', 'Peel and mince enough ginger to give you 2 tsp (save the rest for another use). Place in a small pot.

Reduce heat to low and simmer until tender, 9-11 minutes.', 'Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large, nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Drain pineapple, pouring juice into bowl with lemon juice. Add fruit to pan and cook, tossing occasionally, until just browned, 2-3 minutes. Place in a third small bowl. Wipe out pan and heat a large drizzle of olive oil in it over medium-high heat. Pat chicken with a paper towel. Add to pan and season with salt and pepper. Cook without flipping until browned on bottom, 5-6 minutes.', 'Sprinkle chicken with moo shu spice, then flip. Cook until golden on other side, 4-5 minutes. Pour soy sauce, lemon and pineapple juices, ¼ cup water, and stock concentrates into pan. Let reduce by half, 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 TBSP plain butter; set aside. Using a fork, mash together honey and butter in bowl until smooth; season with salt and pepper. Microwave carrots until tender, 3-4 minutes; toss with 1 TBSP honey butter.', 'Season carrots with salt and pepper. Slice chicken.
