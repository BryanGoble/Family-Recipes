title: 'Spicy Peruvian Cauli & Beef Bowls'
description: "Craving all the tantalizing flavors and textures of a rice bowl (minus the meat?). Look no further, and witness the power of cauliflower! For this spicy vegetarian meal, you’ll build a bowl starting with a bed of fluffy tomato-scallion rice dotted with quick-pickled jalapeño. Top with charred spiced cauliflower, then drizzle with Peruvian-style creamy salsa verde and sprinkle with more lime-pickled jalapeño and scallion greens."

ingredients: ['10 ounce Cauliflower Florets', '1 unit Jalapeño', '2 unit Scallions', '1 unit Lime', '¼ ounce Cilantro', '1 unit Tomato', '1 tablespoon Fajita Spice Blend', '1 teaspoon Garlic Powder', '½ cup Jasmine Rice', '1 unit Veggie Stock Concentrate', '2 tablespoon Mayonnaise', '1.5 tablespoon Sour Cream', ' Salt', ' Pepper', '3 teaspoon Cooking Oil', '¼ teaspoon Sugar', '1 tablespoon Butter', '10 ounce Ground Beef']

instructionTitles: ['Prep', 'Roast Cauliflower', 'Pickle Jalapeño', 'Cook Rice', 'Make Salsa Verde', 'Finish & Serve']
instructions: ['• Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Cut cauliflower into bite-size pieces if necessary. Thinly slice jalapeño into rounds, removing ribs and seeds for less heat. Zest and quarter lime. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Finely chop cilantro. Dice tomato into ½-inch pieces.', '• Toss cauliflower on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of oil, 2 tsp Fajita Spice Blend (4 tsp for 4 servings), salt, and pepper. (You’ll use the rest of the Fajita Spice Blend later.) Roast on top rack until cauliflower is tender, 20-25 minutes. While cauliflower roasts, heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add turkey or beef and season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes.', '• Meanwhile, in a small microwave-safe bowl, combine jalapeño, ¼ tsp sugar, juice from half the lime, and a pinch of salt. (For 4 servings, use ½ tsp sugar and a big pinch of salt.) • Microwave for 30 seconds. Set aside to pickle, stirring occasionally.', '• Melt 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in a small pot over medium heat. Add scallion whites, half the garlic powder (you’ll use the rest later), and remaining Fajita Spice Blend; cook, stirring, until scallion whites are softened, 2-3 minutes. • Add rice, ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4), stock concentrate, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender and water has evaporated, 15-18 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.', '• Remove jalapeño from pickling liquid (reserve liquid). Reserve a few rounds for garnish; mince remaining jalapeño. • In a second small bowl, combine cilantro, mayonnaise, sour cream, remaining garlic powder, a squeeze of lime juice, a big pinch of lime zest, and a pinch of minced jalapeño to taste. TIP: If you’d like more zesty heat, add a small splash of jalapeño pickling liquid instead of, or in addition to, lime juice. • Add water 1 tsp at a time until sauce reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper.', '• Fluff rice with a fork. Stir in tomato, a squeeze of lime juice, and as much remaining minced jalapeño as you like. Taste and season with salt and pepper. • Divide rice between bowls; top with cauliflower. Drizzle everything with salsa verde. Garnish with reserved jalapeño rounds and sprinkle with scallion greens. Serve. Stir turkey or beef into rice along with tomato. Ground Beef is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160°.']
