title: 'Parmesan-Crusted Cod'
description: "So you think you're fancy, huh? Well, here’s a recipe for you: this elegant cod recipe is worthy of the upper crust, literally. The fish fillets are topped with an herbed panko and Parmesan crust that gets nicely browned in the oven. It looks pretty highfalutin, but really, making it is as easy as can be."
