title: 'When Steak Met Potatoes'
description: "When cooking a date-night dinner for a loved one (or indulging in some personal TLC), it’s best to keep it simple, cupid. You’re more likely to impress by showing off your mastery of the classics than by breaking out the brulee blowtorch and nearly setting something on fire. So say “I love you” with a meal that never fails to please: steak and potatoes with creamed veggies and a peppercorn sauce. Call it steak au poivre if you wanna get fancy."
