title: 'Chicken & Mushroom Spaghetti Aglio e Olio'
description: "Spaghetti aglio e olio translates to “spaghetti with garlic and oil”—and that about sums it up! This traditional, rustic dish from Naples turns a few pantry staples into something spectacularly satisfying. In this twist, we keep this dish naturally vegan and add a few extras: blistered grape tomatoes for juicy bursts of sweet flavor, sautéed mushrooms and shallot for earthy savoriness, and lots of fresh, herbaceous parsley. With a side of ciabatta garlic bread and a tangy-sweet balsamic dipper, it’s a dish you won’t need an interpreter to understand—less really is more!"

instructions: ['• Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. (TIP: Cover pot with lid to bring water to a boil more quickly.) Wash and dry produce. • Peel and mince or grate garlic. Thinly slice mushrooms (skip if your mushrooms are pre-sliced!). Halve, peel, and thinly slice shallots. Roughly chop parsley.', '• Once water is boiling, add spaghetti to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water, then drain.', '• While pasta cooks, in a small bowl, combine one-third of the garlic and 2 TBSP olive oil (4 TBSP for 4 servings). Season with salt and pepper to taste.', '• Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over high heat. Add tomatoes; cook, stirring occasionally, until blistered, 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat; transfer to a plate. Wipe out pan. Rinse shrimp under cold water; pat shrimp or chicken dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add shrimp or chicken; cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Turn off heat; transfer to plate used for tomatoes. Wipe out pan.', '• Heat a drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and half the Italian seasoning (all for 4 servings); cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3-5 minutes. • Add shallots, remaining garlic, and as many chili flakes as you like; cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is fragrant and shallots have softened, 2-3 minutes.', '• Halve ciabatta crosswise; brush with half the garlic oil (you may have some left over). Toast on middle rack (TIP: Place directly on oven rack or use a baking sheet) until lightly golden, 2-3 minutes. • Stir drained spaghetti, tomatoes, half the parsley, a drizzle of olive oil, and ½ tsp salt (1 tsp for 4 servings) into pan with mushrooms until combined. (TIP: If pasta seems dry, add reserved pasta water a splash at a time.) Taste and season with salt and pepper if desired.', '• Add as much vinegar as you like to bowl with remaining garlic oil. • Divide pasta between shallow bowls; top with remaining parsley. Serve with garlic bread and balsamic dipper on the side.  Top pasta with shrimp or chicken. Chicken is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 165°.']
