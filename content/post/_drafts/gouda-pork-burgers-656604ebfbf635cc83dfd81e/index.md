title: 'Gouda Pork Burgers'
description: "These bodacious burgers are positively layered with flavor. First, pork patties are infused with an aromatic mix of garlic, onion, and smoked paprika. Topping the cooked patties is nutty, melty gouda, plus a tangle of caramelized onions spiked with Sriracha and lime. Everything gets tucked into toasty potato buns spread with creamy garlic-lime sauce. On the side: a heap of crispy oven fries. Prepare for total taste bud takeover."

instructions: ['• Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion; mince a few slices until you have 2 TBSP (4 TBSP for 4 servings). Zest and quarter lime. Grate garlic. Halve buns.', '• Toss potatoes on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, half the paprika (you’ll use the rest later), and a big pinch of salt and pepper. • Roast on middle rack until browned and tender, 20-25 minutes.', '• Meanwhile, melt 2 TBSP butter (3 TBSP for 4 servings) in a medium pan over medium heat. Add sliced onion, ¼ tsp sugar (½ tsp for 4), and salt. Cook, stirring, until browned and softened, 10-15 minutes. TIP: If onion starts to burn, lower heat and add a splash of water. • Stir in a squeeze of lime juice and Sriracha to taste.', '• While onion cooks, in a large bowl, combine pork*, minced onion, half the garlic, remaining paprika, ½ tsp sugar (1 tsp for 4 servings), and salt. Form into two patties (four for 4), each slightly wider than a burger bun. • Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add patties and cook until browned and cooked through, 4-7 minutes per side. • In the last 1-2 minutes of cooking, top each patty with gouda; cover pan until cheese melts. Remove from pan and set aside.', '• Toast buns until golden. TIP: For a deeper flavor, toast in pan used for patties over medium heat. • While buns toast, in a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, and a squeeze of lime juice. Stir in as much lime zest and remaining garlic as you like. Season with salt and pepper.', '• Spread as much sauce as you like onto bottom buns; fill buns with patties and Sriracha onion. Divide burgers and potato wedges between plates. Serve with any remaining sauce for dipping and lime wedges on the side.   Ground Pork is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160°.']
