title: 'Pork Carnitas Tacos'
description: "Think of this as a quicker, weeknight-friendly version of carnitas—one that doesn’t involve hours of slow-cooking. To create it in minimal time, you’ll add a spice blend and a bit of stock to make ground pork rich and saucy. That warmly flavored meat is the centerpiece of these tacos, which also come with a solid selection of tasty toppings to choose from."
