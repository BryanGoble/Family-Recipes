description: "This cheese-filled pasta, combined with sweet and juicy tomatoes, cukes, scallions, and feta, coated in a tangy dressing might just be your new fave Greek salad—minus the lettuce and plus tender, chewy, tortelloni filled with an Italian cheese power-trio: ricotta, Parm, and mozzarella. It’s served at room temp, making it an ideal office lunch idea (and perfect for potlucks and picnics, too)!"
