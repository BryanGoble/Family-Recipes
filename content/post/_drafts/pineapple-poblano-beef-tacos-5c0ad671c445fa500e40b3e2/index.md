title: 'Pineapple Poblano Beef Tacos'
description: "What’s sweet and nice with a little bit of spice? These tacos! Filled with beef tossed in our blend of warm, earthy spices and topped with a fruity pineapple salsa, they’ve got a perfectly pleasant personality with just a little bit of a wild streak. And just in case you’re not convinced that they’re as congenial as can be, let it be known that they can be prepared in a jiff and are super-duper easy."
