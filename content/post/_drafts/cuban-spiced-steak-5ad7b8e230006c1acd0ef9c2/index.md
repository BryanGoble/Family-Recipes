title: 'Cuban-Spiced Steak'
description: "Steak gets a whole new spin when you coat it in aromatic seasonings. In this recipe, we’re taking sirloin and giving it a Cuban-inspired accent by rubbing it with earthy cumin and herbaceous oregano. The results are big, bold, and full of flavor, especially when paired with spiced rice, caramelized onion, poblano pepper, and a zesty lime sour cream."
