title: 'Sirloin & Sherry Shallot Sauce'
description: "A totally real, verified fact that we just made up: People who cook fancier weeknight dinners are more likely to receive a compliment from a stranger, meet their celebrity crush, and/or win the lottery. They’re also guaranteed to be rewarded with a delicious, steakhouse-quality meal without leaving the comforts of their own kitchen. Case in point: these seared sirloin steaks drizzled in a deluxe, sherry vinegar-spiked pan sauce with crispy, cheesy potato rounds, and a tangy mixed greens salad."
