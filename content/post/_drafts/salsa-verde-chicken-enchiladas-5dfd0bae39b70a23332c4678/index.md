title: 'Salsa Verde Chicken Enchiladas'
description: "When it comes to Mexican food, burritos typically get all the glory. In our humble opinion, enchiladas are an unsung dinner hero. They’re technically just easier-to-assemble burritos smothered in a delicious sauce, but they’re really so much more than that! Ours start with spiced chicken and charred poblano all rolled up in warm tortillas. This winning combo gets topped with tangy salsa verde and cheese, then baked until bubbly and melty. Hear that? That’s the sound of the dinner bell!"
