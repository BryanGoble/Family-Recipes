title: 'Chicken & Sweet Potato Quesadillas'
description: "This quesadilla is jam-packed with flavorful roasted sweet potato and green pepper, plus two types of gooey, melty cheese (how could we choose just one?!). Of course, we’d never forget the toppings—there’s a fresh tomato salsa and dollops of spiced lime crema. Now for the fun part: piling on a little bit of everything to construct the perfect bite!"
