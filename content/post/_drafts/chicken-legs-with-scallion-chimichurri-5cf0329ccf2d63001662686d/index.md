description: "When it comes to chicken, we’re always looking for two things: gorgeous, crackly skin and juicy, flavorful meat. You too? Enter: these pan-seared chicken legs. To make things even more delicious, they’re drizzled with a bright and tangy scallion chimichurri, which perfectly balances the meat’s richness. It’s all sitting atop a bed of fluffy rice, alongside creamy black beans and a cooling lime crema. Sound too good to be true? It’s not! This delicious dish all comes together in 40 minutes. What are you waiting for?!"
