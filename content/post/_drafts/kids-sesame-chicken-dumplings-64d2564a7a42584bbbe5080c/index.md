title: 'Kids’ Sesame Chicken Dumplings'
description: "Does planning, cooking, and packing kids’ lunches + snacks feel like a part-time job? Well, this 15-minute lunch (+ 20-minute snack) is the perfect make-ahead time-saver: a kid-approved dumpling platter with dipping sauce and charred edamame, complete with carrot sticks and juicy pineapple! But wait—it’ll be snacktime before you know it! Whip up a plate of apple “nachos” drizzled with a yogurt and peanut butter-chocolate sauce duo, all sprinkled with chocolate chips. Yup, we’re thinking outside the lunchbox (so you don’t have to!).  "

ingredients: ['9 ounce Carrots', '1 unit Sesame Ginger Chicken Gyoza', '4 ounce Edamame', '12 ounce Pineapple', '1 unit Apple', '1 unit Granny Smith Apple', '1.15 ounce Peanut Butter', '4 teaspoon Honey', '3 ounce Semisweet Chocolate Chips', '2 tablespoon Yogurt', ' Salt', '1 teaspoon Cooking Oil', '1 tablespoon Butter']

instructionTitles: ['Prep', 'Cook Dumplings', 'Char Edamame', 'Serve or Stash Lunch', 'Start Snack', 'Finish Snack']
instructions: ['• Wash and dry produce. • Trim, peel, and cut carrots into sticks (like fries; ours were 3 inches long and 1⁄3 inch thick).', '• Place dumplings in a large microwave-safe bowl (be sure to set dumpling sauce aside; you’ll use it in the next step). Cover dumplings with a damp paper towel; cover bowl with plastic wrap. Microwave until dumplings are steamed and warmed through, 2-3 minutes. • STOVETOP: Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Add dumplings, flat sides down, and cook for 1 minute. (For 6 servings, you may need to work in batches.) Carefully add 1⁄3 cup water; cover and cook until water has evaporated and bottoms are crispy, 4-5 minutes.', '• Heat a drizzle of oil in a small pan over medium-high heat. Add edamame and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and lightly charred in spots, 4-6 minutes. • Stir in dumpling sauce. Cook until sauce has mostly reduced, about 30 seconds.', '• To serve: Divide dumplings and edamame between plates and serve with carrots and pineapple. • To stash: Let dumplings and edamame cool completely. Refrigerate dumplings, edamame, carrots, and pineapple in separate containers and pack as desired.', '• Halve, core, and thinly slice apples. TIP: If you have a lemon on hand, toss sliced apples with 1 TBSP lemon juice to prevent apples from browning! • Place peanut butter, honey, half the chocolate chips, and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 6 servings) in a medium microwave-safe bowl; cover with plastic wrap. Microwave until peanut butter is softened and chocolate chips are melted, 30-45 seconds. Add a pinch of salt. Whisk until smooth and combined. • In a small bowl, combine yogurt and 1 tsp water (1½ tsp for 6).', '• Fan out apple slices on a large parchment-lined plate (it’s OK if they overlap!). Drizzle with as much peanut butter chocolate sauce and yogurt as you like. (TIP: It’s normal for the chocolate sauce to harden slightly as it cools.) Sprinkle remaining chocolate chips over top. • Storage suggestion: Wrap plate with apple “nachos” tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to serve! Chicken Dumplings are fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 165°.']
