Remove from heat and keep covered.', 'Toss green beans with a large drizzle of oil on a baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in oven until crisp, 10-12 minutes. After they’ve finished roasting, toss green beans with 2 tsp sesame oil, half the sesame seeds, and a squeeze of lime (we sent more oil than needed).', 'Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Pat chicken dry with a paper towel. Add to pan and cook until browned but not cooked through, 2-4 minutes per side. Remove from pan and set aside. TIP: Don’t overcrowd the pan with chicken—you may want to work in batches.', 'Heat a large drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Whisk together soy sauce, ¼ cup sugar, 2 TBSP vinegar (we sent more), and cornstarch in a small bowl. Put scallion whites, garlic, and ginger in pan and cook, tossing, until softened, 1-2 minutes. Stir in soy sauce mixture and bring to a simmer. Let thicken slightly, about 2 minutes.', 'Add chicken to pan and toss to coat. Cook until no longer pink in center, 2-3 minutes. Add a squeeze of lime to rice, then fluff with a fork. Divide rice, green beans, and chicken between plates. Drizzle with any sauce in pan. Sprinkle with scallion greens and remaining sesame seeds. Serve with lime wedges.']
