title: 'Chicken Parm Salad'
description: "Say hello to our October Meal of the Month: a lighter, brighter twist on classic chicken Parmesan. The chicken breasts are baked, not fried, and served over spinach salad with a freshly squeezed lemon dressing. It’s got all of the cheesy, breaded goodness you know and love in a less over-the-top package. And if you do love it, you can order it again next week."
