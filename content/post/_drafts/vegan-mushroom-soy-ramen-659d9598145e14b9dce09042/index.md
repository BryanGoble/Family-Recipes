title: 'Chicken, Mushroom & Soy Ramen'
description: "Our chefs are obsessed with ramen—and no, we don’t mean the instant variety. We’re talking about that soul-stirring combination of rich miso broth, ginger-soy mushrooms, and a tangle of chewy noodles. For this veggie-centric version, each bowl is topped with crispy fried onions, scallion greens, and as much (or little!) Sriracha as your heart desires."
