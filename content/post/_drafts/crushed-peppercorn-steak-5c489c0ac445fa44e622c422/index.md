description: "Although there’s a wide world of food to explore, sometimes you just wanna stick to the classics. We get it. But to make a tried-and-true recipe dazzle, you’ve got to maximize the power of your ingredients. Which is why we’re adding a freshly cracked peppercorn sauce to this steak and potatoes dish; crushing those ’corns by hand releases their essential oils and adds incredible depth."
