title: 'One-Pan Orzo Italiano'
description: "Pasta night just got so easy, it’s mind-boggling. Everything in this recipe (and we really mean everything) is made in a single pan. And since the orzo is cooked risotto-style, with just the minimum amount of water it needs to get al dente, you don’t even have to drain it. The only thing that’s not minimal is the flavor: with chicken sausage, warmed tomatoes, and Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses, it’s about as big and bold as you can get."
