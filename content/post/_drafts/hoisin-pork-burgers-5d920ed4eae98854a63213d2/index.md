title: 'Hoisin Pork Burgers'
description: "Burgers, meet banh mi. Banh mi, meet burgers. Yeah, we think this is going to be the start of a beautiful friendship. This week, our chefs introduced our two favorite (aforementioned) foods, creating a mash-up for the ages. To do it, they swapped traditional beef for pork, glazed the patties with umami-packed hoisin, and topped them with a tangy cucumber-carrot slaw and sriracha mayo. Everything is sandwiched between squishy potato buns for a burger so delicious, you may find yourself with a new BFF (best food friend, that is)."

ingredients: ['12 ounce Yukon Gold Potatoes', '3 ounce Carrot', '1 unit Persian Cucumber', '1 unit Lime', '1 tablespoon Sesame Oil', '2 tablespoon Mayonnaise', '1 teaspoon Sriracha', '10 ounce Ground Pork', '2 tablespoon Hoisin Sauce', '2 unit Potato Buns', '1 tablespoon Vegetable Oil', ' Salt', ' Pepper']

instructionTitles: ['Prep and Roast Potatoes', 'Make Slaw', 'Make Sriracha Mayo', 'Form Patties', 'Cook and Glaze Patties', 'Finish and Serve']
instructions: ['Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Toss on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast on top rack until golden brown and crispy, 20-25 minutes.', 'Meanwhile, trim, peel, and grate carrot on the largest holes of a box grater; transfer to a medium bowl. Trim and halve cucumber lengthwise; thinly slice into half-moons. Halve lime. Add cucumber, juice from whole lime (both limes for 4 servings), and half the sesame oil (you’ll use the rest later) to bowl with grated carrot; toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper.', 'In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise and sriracha to taste. Season with salt and pepper.', 'In a large bowl, combine pork and remaining sesame oil. Season generously with salt (we used ¾ tsp; use 1½ tsp for 4 servings) and pepper. Form into two equal-sized patties (four patties for 4), each a bit wider than a burger bun.', 'Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add patties and cook until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes per side. Turn off heat; carefully pour out any excess grease from pan. Stir in hoisin sauce; flip patties to fully coat.', 'While patties cook, halve and toast buns. Fill toasted buns with patties, any remaining hoisin from pan, and a bit of slaw and sriracha mayo. Serve with potato wedges and any remaining slaw on the side. TIP: If you’ve got some, serve with ketchup for dipping.']
