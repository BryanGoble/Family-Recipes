title: 'Szechuan Noodles with Mushrooms & Carrot'
description: "Sometimes, a sauce just steals the show. Case in point? This version, which combines zingy, spicy, aromatic Szechuan paste with tangy-sweet soy glaze. Totally mouthwatering and packed with umami flavor, it pairs perfectly with a tangle of chewy ramen noodles, plus stir-fried mushrooms, carrots, and scallions. Each bowl is topped with a perfectly cooked fried egg and served with lime wedges for extra brightness."
