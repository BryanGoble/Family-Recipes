title: 'One-Pan Beef Stir-Fry Tacos'
description: "We’re always up for a sweet and savory dinner pairing, and these tacos are just that. Ground pork and green pepper are cooked in a sweet soy glaze until sticky and tender. They’re stuffed into steamy tortillas, along with a tangy, cilantro-flecked cabbage slaw. Of course, we’d never skip out on taco toppings, and these ones don’t disappoint: There’s creamy, spicy Sriracha mayo and crispy fried onions. It’s all ready in just 15 minutes—life is sweet (and savory), friends."
