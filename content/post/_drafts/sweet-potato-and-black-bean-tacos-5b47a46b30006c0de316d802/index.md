title: 'Sweet Potato and Black Bean Tacos'
description: "Not many tacos can boast that they’re rich in vitamin A. Ours, however, are full of it, thanks to tender roasted cubes of sweet potato. They’re joined by black beans and a zesty avocado crema for some of the most delectable veggie goodness to be found inside the fold of a tortilla. You could say that they bring their A-game in every single way."

Zest ½ tsp zest from lime, then cut into halves.', 'Heat 1 TBSP olive oil in a large pan  over medium heat. Add onion and cook, tossing occasionally, until softened, 5-6 minutes.

Toss sweet potatoes, honey, cumin, and juice from one lime half into pan with beans and cook until liquid is mostly evaporated, 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.', 'Halve, pit, and peel avocado. Cut one half into thin slices. Roughly chop other half and place in a medium bowl along with sour cream, juice from remaining lime half, and lime zest.  Mash with a fork until mostly smooth. Season with salt and pepper.', 'Spread avocado crema onto tortillas, then top each with filling, avocado slices, and cilantro. TIP: Break out the hot sauce if you like it spicy.']
