title: 'Crispy Chicken Milanese'
description: "The secret to flawless chicken Milanese is butterflying—that means splitting the breasts into cutlets so that you not only have more surface area for the crispy breadcrumbs to adhere to, but also a thinner piece of meat that cooks quickly in the pan. All that deliciousness is best with an easy breezy side—in this case, a lemony arugula salad with slices of succulent yellow squash."

instructionTitles: ['Preheat and Prep', 'Roast Squash', 'Butterfly Chicken', 'Cook Chicken', 'Make Salad', 'Plate and Serve']
instructions: ['Wash and dry all produce. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Halve tomatoes lengthwise. Halve, peel, and finely chop shallot until you have 1 TBSP. Halve lemon; cut one half into wedges. Slice squash crosswise into ¼-inch-thick rounds. Place panko in a shallow dish.', 'Toss squash, a drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper on a baking sheet. Roast in oven until lightly browned, 10-15 minutes, flipping halfway through.', 'With your hand on one chicken breast, cut ¾ of the way through center, parallel to cutting board, stopping before you slice through. Repeat with other breast. Open each up and season all over with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Brush with sour cream, then press into panko in dish to coat all over.', 'Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink in center, 3-4 minutes per side. TIP: A nonstick pan is great for frying and helps the crust stick to the food and not the pan. Get one at HelloFresh.com/Shop', 'Place chopped shallot, juice from one lemon half, and a large drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Add arugula and tomatoes and toss to coat.', 'Thinly slice chicken. Divide salad between plates. Top with squash and chicken. Serve with lemon wedges to the side for squeezing over.']
