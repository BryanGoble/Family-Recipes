ingredients: ['2 clove Garlic', '4 tablespoon Yogurt', '10 ounce Chicken Cutlets', '1 unit Zucchini', '1 unit Roma Tomato', '2 unit Scallions', '1 unit Lemon', '4 tablespoon Sour Cream', '1 unit Chicken Stock Concentrate', '1 teaspoon Turmeric', '½ cup Couscous', '4 tablespoon Hummus', '1 teaspoon Hot Sauce', '1 tablespoon Shawarma Spice Blend', ' Salt', ' Pepper', '2 tablespoon Olive Oil', '1 tablespoon Butter']

instructions: ['Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Mince garlic. In a medium bowl, combine yogurt, half the garlic, half the Shawarma Spice (you’ll use the rest later), 1 TBSP olive oil, 1 tsp salt, and pepper. (For 4 servings, use 2 TBSP olive oil and 2 tsp salt.) Pat chicken dry with paper towels; add to bowl and turn to coat. Set aside to marinate.', 'Trim and dice zucchini into ½-inch pieces. Dice tomato into 1-inch pieces. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Quarter lemon. In a small bowl, combine sour cream and remaining garlic to taste. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.', 'Toss zucchini and tomato on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil, remaining Shawarma Spice, salt, and pepper. Roast on top rack until veggies are browned and tender, 15-18 minutes.', 'Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium heat. Remove chicken from marinade; allow excess to drip off. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 6-8 minutes per side. (TIP: Medium heat is key in preventing the marinade from burning. If chicken begins to brown too quickly, lower the heat.) Turn off heat; transfer chicken to a cutting board. Once cool enough to handle, slice crosswise.', 'While chicken cooks, heat a drizzle of olive oil in a small pot over mediumhigh heat. Add scallion whites; cook until slightly softened, 1 minute. Add stock concentrate, ¾ cup water, ¼ tsp turmeric (be sure to measure), 1 TBSP butter, and a pinch of salt. (For 4 servings, use 1½ cups water, ½ tsp turmeric, and 2 TBSP butter.) Once boiling, stir in couscous; cover pot and remove from heat. Let stand until water has absorbed and couscous is tender, at least 5 minutes.', 'Fluff couscous with a fork and season with salt and pepper. Toss roasted veggies with a big squeeze of lemon juice. Divide couscous and veggies between bowls; top with chicken and dollop with hummus. Drizzle with white sauce and hot sauce to taste. Sprinkle with scallion greens. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.']
