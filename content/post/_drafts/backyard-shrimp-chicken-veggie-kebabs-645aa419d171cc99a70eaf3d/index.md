title: 'Backyard Shrimp, Chicken & Veggie Kebabs'
description: "We just have to ask: Are you ready for summer?! Sure you’ve got the warm evening breezes, the crickets, the summer jams; but are you ready to get your grilling on? We sure are. Enter: this trio of delicious kebabs. You’ve got lemon-garlic marinated shrimp, charred Cajun chicken, and Turkish spice-rubbed zucchini and tomato on skewers, along with a rich garlic aioli for dipping. Our suggestion: Sit outside and just use paper plates tonight (+ chill a bottle of rosé)!"
