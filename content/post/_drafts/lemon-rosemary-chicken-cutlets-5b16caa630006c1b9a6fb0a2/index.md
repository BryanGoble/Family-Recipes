title: 'Lemon Rosemary Chicken Cutlets'
description: "A quicker chicken dinner? Check! We’ve got you covered. These cutlets are ready and on the table in just about 20 minutes, yet they’re as sophisticated as something you’d find at your favorite bistro. All this light, summery recipe takes is a little sautéing action for the meat and heirloom grape tomatoes, plus a quick boil for the herbed couscous."
