title: 'Slow Cooker Kickin’ Cashew Chicken'
description: "We all know the slow cooker is a game-changer for big-batch, make-ahead, easy-peasy meals. Case in point? This savory, orange-scented shredded chicken with snow peas that bubbles away happily in a combination of hoisin, soy sauce, onion, and sweet chili sauce. Serve this savory, sweet, and spicy sensation over fluffy jasmine rice, sprinkle with crunchy cashews, and watch your hungry crowd devour it—or save it for yourself and eat like a royal all week long!"
