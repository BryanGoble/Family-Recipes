title: 'Mojo-Drizzled New York Strip Steak'
description: "Mojo is a Cuban-style sauce that keeps it light yet delivers majorly in terms of flavor. Based around fresh-squeezed citrus juices, it can perk up the rich flavor of strip steak and add new dimensions to potatoes and veggies. It’s mouth-puckering and herbaceous in such an addictive way that you’ll likely find yourself dipping every inch of every bite into it."
