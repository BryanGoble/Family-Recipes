title: 'Mediterranean Couscous Bowls'
description: "Hummus: not just for pita chips anymore! This versatile dip is the perfect topper for these Mediterranean power bowls. Here, it’s mixed with smoky paprika for a delicious flavor boost. In case you were wondering, underneath the hummus lies a whole world of deliciousness. At the base, there’s fluffy, Turkish-spiced couscous mixed with lemon zest. On top, you’ve also got cucumber-dill salad, roasted bell pepper and tomato, creamy lemon sauce, and crumbly feta cheese. Together, it’s a multi-layered melange that’ll knock your chickpea-loving socks off."
