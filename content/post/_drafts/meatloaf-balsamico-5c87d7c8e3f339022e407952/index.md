title: 'Meatloaf Balsamico'
description: "No matter which way you try to dress it up, a meatloaf is all about the meat. Which is why we’re adding little more than a few breadcrumbs to keep it moist and a smattering of balsamic ketchup glaze to keep things interesting. That’s all you really need (along with some green beans and mashed sweet potato) to emphasize the classic timelessness of this dish."

instructionTitles: ['Preheat and Prep', 'Shape Meatloaves', 'Cook Meatloaves and Sweet Potatoes', 'Roast Green Beans', 'Mash Sweet Potatoes', 'Finish and Serve']
instructions: ['Wash and dry all produce. Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a small bowl, mix 1 TBSP vinegar (we sent more) and ketchup. Mince 1 clove garlic (use other as you like). Chop parsley. Halve and peel onion. Using the large holes of a grater, grate one onion half into a large bowl (use the other half as you like).', 'Add garlic, parsley, ¼ cup panko (we sent more), beef, and ½ tsp salt to bowl with onion. Crack in 1 egg (use the other as you like). Season with pepper, then mix with hands to combine. Shape into two 1-inch-tall loaves, then place on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Brush with ketchup mixture.', 'Roast meatloaves in oven until cooked through, about 25 minutes total (we’ll check on them after 10 minutes). Meanwhile, peel sweet potatoes, then cut into ½-inch cubes. Place in a medium pot with a pinch of salt and enough water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 10 minutes.', 'After meatloaves have baked 10 minutes, remove baking sheet from oven. Toss green beans on same sheet with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. (TIP: Use tongs to avoid burns.) Return to oven and roast until meatloaves are cooked through and green beans are tender and lightly crisped, about 15 minutes more.', 'Drain sweet potatoes and return to pot. Mash in pot with a potato masher or fork until mostly smooth. (TIP: If potatoes have cooled, quickly reheat over medium-low heat.) Add 1 TBSP butter and honey. Continue mashing to combine and melt butter. Season generously with salt and pepper.', 'Once meatloaves and green beans are done, sprinkle almonds over green beans and toss to combine. Divide meatloaves between plates and serve with sweet potato mash and green beans on the side.']
