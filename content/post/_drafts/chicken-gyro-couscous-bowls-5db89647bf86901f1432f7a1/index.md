title: 'Chicken Gyro Couscous Bowls'
description: "Hummus and pita chips go together like...well, hummus and pita chips! And while that may be, we firmly believe that hummus is destined for bigger and better things. Case in point: this delicious, layered bowl. It starts with a base of hummus, then it’s piled with chewy Isareli couscous, za’atar-spiced chicken, lemony chopped salad, tangy feta sauce, and a sprinkle of fresh dill. This mix of vibrant, crunchy, creamy, and savory components is sure to satisfy. Beat that, chips!"

ingredients: ['1 unit Shallot', '4 ounce Heirloom Grape Tomatoes', '1 unit Persian Cucumber', '1 unit Lemon', '¼ ounce Dill', '½ cup Israeli Couscous', '1 unit Chicken Stock Concentrate', '10 ounce Chicken Cutlets', "1 teaspoon Za'atar Spice", '½ cup Feta Cheese', '2 tablespoon Sour Cream', '4 teaspoon Olive Oil', ' Salt', ' Pepper', '4 tablespoon Sabra® Classic Hummus']

instructionTitles: ['Prep', 'Make Salad', 'Cook Couscous', 'Cook Chicken', 'Make Feta Sauce', 'Serve']
instructions: ['Wash and dry all produce. Halve and peel shallot; thinly slice half the shallot and mince remaining. Fill a small bowl with cold water; add sliced shallot and let soak. (TIP: This helps mellow its sharp bite.) Quarter tomatoes. Trim and dice cucumber. Zest and quarter lemon (quarter both lemons for 4 servings). Pick and finely chop fronds from dill.', 'Drain sliced shallot and place in a medium bowl. Toss with tomatoes, cucumber, juice from half the lemon, a drizzle of olive oil, and 1 TBSP dill (2 TBSP for 4). Season with salt and pepper.', 'Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add minced shallot; cook until softened, 1-2 minutes. Add couscous and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until toasted, 2-3 minutes. Add ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4) and stock concentrate. Bring to a boil; cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until couscous is tender, 6-8 minutes. Drain any excess water, if necessary. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Keep covered off heat.', 'Meanwhile, pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with ½ tsp Za’atar Spice (1 tsp for 4 servings; we sent more), salt, and pepper. Heat a large drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side. (TIP: Work in batches, if necessary.) Transfer chicken to a cutting board. When cool enough to handle, thinly slice crosswise.', 'While chicken cooks, in a second small bowl, combine feta, sour cream, and lemon zest to taste; mash together with a fork. (TIP: If the feta is cold, massage in the bag first to soften.) Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. (It’s okay if the sauce isn’t completely smooth.)', 'Spread hummus on one side of each serving bowl. Fluff couscous with a fork; divide between bowls next to hummus. Top couscous with chicken. Drain excess liquid from salad; arrange over hummus. Drizzle everything with feta sauce. Garnish with remaining dill if desired. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.']
