title: 'Pork Luau Burgers'
description: "Pork-and-pineapple is one of those combos that will make your taste buds do the hula, glow with sunshine, and ride the wave to Flavor Beach. Naturally, we had to find a way to turn that into a burger. Ground pork’s savoriness is amped up further by garlic and soy, and then with a touch of honey that complements the sweetness of the warm pineapple relish spiked with slivers of onion."
