title: 'Figgy Balsamic Pork'
description: "You’ve likely come across figs baked into desserts, dried and nestled onto cheese platters, or preserved and slathered on toast for breakfast. But today, we’re mixing things up by pairing fig jam with tangy balsamic vinegar. The result? A sweet and savory sauce that’ll transform the tender pork tenderloin it’s drizzled on top of."
