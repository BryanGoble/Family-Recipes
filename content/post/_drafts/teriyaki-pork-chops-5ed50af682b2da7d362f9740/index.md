title: 'Teriyaki Pork Chops'
description: "Pork chops are always a weeknight winner. They’re satisfying, speedy, and so versatile, which is why our chefs are always brainstorming new ways to take them to the next level. This week, they went ~all in umami~ by drizzling ‘em with a savory-sweet teriyaki sauce. On the side, there’s gingery roasted carrots and some fluffy, scallion-studded jasmine rice (perfect for catching any runaway sauce). Prepare for a flavor explosion!"
