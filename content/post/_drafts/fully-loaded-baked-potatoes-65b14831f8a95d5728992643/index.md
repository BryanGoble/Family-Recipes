title: 'Fully Loaded Baked Potatoes'
description: "There’s nothing more comforting than a baked potato with all the fixings! Here, you’ll bake potatoes until tender, fluff them with butter, then top them with a symphony of savory flavors and textures: crispy chopped bacon, tangy sour cream, and crunchy, buttery fried onions. The best part is that you can serve the potatoes as a side or simply enjoy them for a meal (in our book, potatoes are a perfectly acceptable main course)."

instructionTitles: []
instructions: ['Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce.', 'Place bacon on a baking sheet in a single layer. Roast on middle rack until crispy, 15-20 minutes. (Check often to avoid burning!) Transfer bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate (keep sheet handy for potatoes; don’t discard the fat!). Once cool enough to handle, roughly chop.  Bacon is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 145°.', 'Meanwhile, poke potatoes all over with a fork and place on a microwave-safe plate; rub with oil and season with salt and pepper. Microwave, flipping halfway through, until tender, 9-13 minutes.', 'Carefully transfer potatoes to sheet used for bacon. Bake on middle rack until skins are crispy and browned, 12-15 minutes. Carefully remove sheet from oven. Halve potatoes lengthwise; fluff insides with a fork. Top each half with 1 TBSP butter and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with cheese, then return to middle rack until cheese melts, 2-3 minutes.', 'Top potato halves with sour cream, bacon, and crispy fried onions.', 'RECIPE SUGGESTION (Additional ingredients not included.) Have fresh herbs on hand? Roughly chop some and sprinkle on top of potatoes (we like dill, chives, or parsley!)']
