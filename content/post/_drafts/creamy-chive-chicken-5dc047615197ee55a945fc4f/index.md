title: 'Creamy Chive Chicken'
description: "We’re big fans of pan sauces because they’re an easy way to add tons of restaurant-level flavor to your dish. Here, tangy lemon juice, punchy dijon, sour cream, and fresh chives mingle to create a condiment that truly takes seared chicken to the next level. On the side, there’s zesty lemon rice and a green salad that’s bursting with crispy pieces of apple...because you only deserve the best!"
