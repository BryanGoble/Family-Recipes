title: 'Vegan Thai Green Curry with Chickpeas'
description: "If that craving for a creamy, flavorful curry just can’t wait, you’re in luck: This vegan version comes together in just 20 minutes. Chickpeas, zucchini, cabbage, and carrots simmer in a spicy green coconut curry infused with zippy ginger and lime juice. Once the veggies are tender and the sauce is thickened, it’s time to spoon everything over fluffy jasmine rice and sprinkle with scallion greens and a squeeze of fresh lime juice. Talk about a game-changing plant-based dinner idea!"
