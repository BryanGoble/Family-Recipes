instructions: ['Wash and dry all produce. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Thinly slice garlic. In a small bowl, combine panko, Parmesan, and a drizzle of olive oil.', 'Place chicken on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Season all over with salt and pepper. Top chicken with panko mixture, pressing to adhere. Add grape tomatoes to same sheet and toss with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Bake in oven until chicken is cooked through and tomatoes are softened, about 15 minutes.', 'Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat (use an ovenproof pan if you have one). Add garlic to pan and cook until just starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes, onion powder, and 2 tsp Italian seasoning (we sent more). Season with salt and pepper. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.', 'Once water is boiling, add rigatoni to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. Drain.', 'Once chicken and tomatoes are done, transfer to pan and lay on top of sauce. (TIP: If your pan isn’t ovenproof, transfer sauce to a small baking dish first.) Tear mozzarella into small pieces and scatter over pan. Transfer pan to oven and bake until cheese melts, about 2 minutes.', 'Divide rigatoni between plates, then top with chicken, tomatoes, and sauce and serve.']
