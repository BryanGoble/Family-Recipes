title: 'Honey Miso Chicken & ’Shroom Jumble'
description: "Craving a jumble of roasted veggies for dinner? We’ve got just the thing. Here, we roast sweet potato, mushrooms, onion, and zucchini until tender, then toss with a ginger-infused honey miso dressing for sweet and savory flavor. The veggies are all piled over buttery lime rice, then drizzled with a creamy chili sauce for a little heat and sprinkled with sesame seeds for crunch. Hearty, saucy, and oh-so satisfying—it doesn’t get any better than that."

(You’ll use the remaining Fry Seasoning in the next step.) • Roast on middle rack for 5 minutes (you’ll start the zucchini then).', '• Meanwhile, toss zucchini on a second baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, remaining Fry Seasoning, and salt. • Once veggies have roasted 5 minutes, place sheet with zucchini on top rack. Roast until everything is browned and tender, 15-20 minutes more. Pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook until browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board to rest.', '• Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine honey, miso sauce concentrate, a big squeeze of lime juice, and ginger to taste. • In a separate small bowl, combine mayonnaise, chili sauce, and a squeeze of lime juice. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.', '• Once veggies and zucchini are done, combine on a baking sheet and toss with honey-miso dressing. • Fluff rice with a fork; stir in lime zest and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings). Season with salt. • Divide rice between shallow bowls or plates. Top with sweet potato and mushroom jumble. Drizzle with creamy chili sauce and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side. Slice chicken crosswise. Top rice with chicken along with sweet potato and mushroom jumble.
