title: 'Salmon Limone'
description: "Limone is Italian for lemon, so you know this fish dish is going to have some vitamin-C-packing sour power. But that’s only the start of it: there are veggies and herbs and beautiful fillets, too. Bubbly Israeli couscous is toasted and simmered with a little butter. Then the salmon is dusted with our Italian seasoning and seared in the pan. But the real showstopper might be the zucchini ribbon salad, which is a pretty as it is delightfully refreshing (and fun to twirl around your fork)."

instructions: ['Wash and dry all produce. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Dice tomato.', 'Melt 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in a medium pot over mediumhigh heat. Add couscous and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly toasted, 2-3 minutes.

Pour out any excess liquid, if necessary. Cover pot and set aside.', 'Rinse salmon, then pat dry with paper towels. Season all over with salt, pepper, and Italian Seasoning. Heat 1 TBSP butter and 1 TBSP olive oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Add salmon skin sides down and cook until skin is browned and crispy, 3-4 minutes. Flip and cook until fish is opaque and cooked through, 3-4 minutes more. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate.', 'Meanwhile, using a peeler, shave zucchini lengthwise into ribbons, rotating as you go, until you get to the seedy core; discard core. Zest and halve lemon; cut one half into 2 wedges (for 4 servings, halve one lemon and quarter other). In a medium bowl, combine scallion greens, tomato, and zucchini ribbons. Add a large drizzle of olive oil and juice from lemon half (two halves for 4). Season with salt and pepper and toss to combine.', 'Reserve ¼ tsp lemon zest (½ tsp for 4 servings). Fluff couscous with a fork; stir in scallion whites and remaining lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, combine sour cream, reserved lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.', 'Divide couscous between bowls or plates; top with salmon and salad. Drizzle crema over everything. Serve with lemon wedges on the side.']
