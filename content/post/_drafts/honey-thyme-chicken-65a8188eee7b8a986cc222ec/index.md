title: 'Honey Thyme Chicken'
description: "A honey-based sauce may sound like something that goes with dessert, but mild-tasting pork loves a sweet sauce too, especially one that has a few savory elements added to the mix. In this recipe, you’ll be folding an extra-large drizzle of honey into a rich, savory pan sauce, then spooning it onto pork tenderloin. (We recommend spooning it on the roasted potatoes and side of green beans, too!)"

instructions: ['• Adjust racks to top and middle positions and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Dice potatoes into ½-inch pieces. Toss on one side of a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. • Roast on middle rack until lightly browned and tender, 20-25 minutes total. (You’ll add more to the sheet after 10 minutes.)', '• Meanwhile, pat pork* dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook, turning occasionally, until browned all over, 6-8 minutes (it’ll finish cooking in step 4). • While pork cooks, trim green beans if necessary. Peel and mince garlic. Swap in chicken or beef for pork. Cook chicken until cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side, or cook beef to desired doneness, 4-7 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board; tent with foil to keep warm.', '• Once potatoes have roasted 10 minutes, remove sheet from oven; carefully toss, keeping on one side. • Toss green beans on empty side with a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. • Return to middle rack until veggies are tender, 10-12 minutes more.', '• Once pork is browned all over, transfer to a second baking sheet. • Roast on top rack until pork is cooked through, 8-12 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board. If using chicken or beef, skip this step!', '• Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for pork over medium heat. Add garlic and thyme; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. • Stir in stock concentrates, honey, and ¼ cup water (½ cup for 4 servings). Simmer, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan, until reduced by half, 3-4 minutes. • Stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4) until melted. Season with salt and pepper. TIP: If sauce seems too thick, stir in a splash or two of water.', '• Thinly slice pork crosswise. • Divide pork, green beans, and potatoes between plates. Drizzle pork with sauce and serve. Thinly slice chicken or beef against the grain. Chicken is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 165º.']
