title: 'Pizza Empanadas'
description: "Flaky, cheesy, and filled with margherita pizza flavors (like tomato sauce, basil, and mozzarella cheese), these savory Latin-American pastries are the perfect appetizer or snack for any mealtime or gathering. All you have to do is bake or air-fry them to golden perfection, and share! We like to dip them in sour cream and salsa, but feel free to serve them with your favorite dips and toppings."
