title: 'Sweet Chili Chicken Sandos'
description: "This sando has it all: sweet, salty, tangy, spicy, and of course, crunchy (we’ve got a whole slaw for that!). Sizzle up our fully cooked chicken with scallions and garlic, then coat with a warm soy-chili glaze. You’ll layer it with tangy, creamy cabbage-carrot slaw and crispy fried onions in a toasted baguette, and serve it alongside more crunchy, slightly spicy slaw for a fresh and flavorful 15-minute lunch idea."
