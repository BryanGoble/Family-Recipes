title: 'Sirloin Steak Provençal'
description: "You probably haven’t tasted steak like this before: this sirloin is seasoned with Herbs de Provence—a blend of aromatics from the south of France that includes lavender, rosemary, and tarragon. Together, the meat and aromatics create some truly extraordinary flavors that feel right at home next to the dynamic sides—those would be roasted potatoes and carrots, a rich pan sauce, and a dollop of truffle-flavored sour cream."

instructionTitles: ['Start Prep', 'Roast Veggies', 'Finish Prep and Make Truffle Cream', 'Cook Steak', 'Make Pan Sauce', 'Finish and Serve']
instructions: ['Adjust rack to top position (top and middle positions for 4 servings) and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Halve potatoes, then cut into ½-inch-thick wedges. Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into 1-inch-thick pieces. Pat steak dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Let sit at room temperature until ready to cook.', 'Place potatoes and carrots on opposite sides of a baking sheet. Toss each with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast on top rack until browned and tender, 25-30 minutes. (For 4 servings, divide veggies between 2 baking sheets; roast potatoes on top rack and carrots on middle rack.)', 'Meanwhile, trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Halve, peel, and finely chop shallot. In a small bowl, combine sour cream, a drizzle of olive oil, and truffle zest (start with a pinch, then taste and add more from there if desired). Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.', 'Pat steak dry with paper towels again. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook until nicely browned on first side, 3-6 minutes. Flip and lower heat to medium. Add 1 tsp Herbes de Provence (2 tsp for 4 servings; we sent more) and 2 TBSP butter (4 TBSP for 4) to pan. Carefully tilt pan toward you. Using a spoon, continually baste steak with butter until it reaches desired doneness, 6-9 minutes more. Leaving butter in pan, transfer steak to a cutting board to rest.', 'Heat same pan over medium-high heat and add scallion whites and shallot. Cook, stirring, until softened, 2-3 minutes. Add stock concentrate and ¼ cup water (⅓ cup for 4 servings). Bring to a simmer and cook until slightly thickened, 2-3 minutes.', 'Thinly slice steak against the grain. Divide steak, potatoes, and carrots between plates. Stir any resting juices from steak into pan sauce. Drizzle sauce over steak and garnish with scallion greens. Serve with truffle cream on the side for dipping.']
