description: "If you love hot sauce with every meal, these burgers are for you. We blend ground beef patties with both tangy hot sauce AND Frank’s seasoning for layers of spicy, zesty flavor, then top them with Monterey Jack for the melt-factor. They’re sandwiched between toasted potato buns and topped with crispy fried onions and a generous swipe of creamy ranch for cooling contrast. After all, how does that old saying go—“hot sauce and spice makes everything nice”? That sounds right to us."

ingredients: ['12 ounce Potatoes', '1 teaspoon Garlic Powder', '1.5 tablespoon Sour Cream', '1.5 ounce Buttermilk Ranch Dressing', "¼ ounce Frank's RedHot® Original Seasoning Blend", '1 unit Frank’s RedHot® Original Cayenne Pepper Sauce', '10 ounce Ground Beef', '¼ cup Monterey Jack Cheese', '2 unit Potato Buns', '1 unit Crispy Fried Onions', ' Salt', ' Pepper', '4 teaspoon Cooking Oil', '6 ounce Asparagus']

instructionTitles: ['Roast Potatoes', 'Make Sauce', 'Form & Cook Patties', 'Finish & Serve']
instructions: ['• Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Toss on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of oil, half the garlic powder (you’ll use the rest later), and a big pinch of salt and pepper. • Roast on middle rack until browned and tender, 20-25 minutes. Cut broccoli into bite-size pieces if necessary or trim and discard woody bottom ends from asparagus. Swap in broccoli or asparagus for potatoes; roast 12-15 minutes for broccoli or 10-12 minutes for asparagus. (Save potatoes for another use.)', '• While potatoes roast, in a small bowl, combine sour cream, ranch dressing, and remaining garlic powder; season with salt and pepper. TIP: If you like things spicy, add a dash of hot sauce—just be sure to save some for forming your patties!', '• In a large bowl, combine beef*, Frank’s RedHot® Original Seasoning Blend, a dash of Frank’s hot sauce, and salt. Form into two patties (four patties for 4 servings), each slightly wider than a burger bun. •Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add patties and cook until browned and cooked to desired doneness, 3-5 minutes per side. In the last 1-2 minutes of cooking, top patties with Monterey Jack; cover pan to melt cheese.', '• While patties cook, halve and toast buns. Spread cut sides with creamy ranch sauce, then fill with patties and crispy fried onions. • Divide burgers between plates and serve with potato wedges on the side. Ground Beef is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160°.']
