title: 'Pork and Veggie Bibimbap'
description: "This dish takes its name from the Korean word for mixing rice. Which is exactly what you’re meant to do after serving it: put your rice in a bowl, add the toppings, and mix it all together so that those flavors and textures combine in a glorious mishmash. There are plenty of flavors and textures going on here, too, like sweet carrot, juicy zucchini, and pork tossed with garlic, ginger, and soy."

instructions: ['In a small pot, combine rice, 1¼ cups water (2¼ cups for 4 servings), and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.', 'Meanwhile, wash and dry all produce. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Trim and peel carrots. Using a peeler, shave carrots lengthwise into ribbons, rotating as you go. Trim and halve zucchini lengthwise; thinly slice crosswise into half-moons. Peel and mince ginger. Mince garlic.', 'In a small bowl, combine scallion whites, vinegar, and a pinch of salt. Set aside to marinate, stirring occasionally, until ready to serve. In a separate small bowl, combine sesame oil, half the soy sauce, up to half the sriracha, and 1 TBSP sugar (2 TBSP for 4 servings). Stir until sugar has dissolved.', 'Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Add carrot ribbons; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 3-4 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside. Add another drizzle of oil to pan. Add zucchini; season with salt and pepper. Cook until browned and tender, 3-5 minutes per side. Remove from pan and set aside with carrots.', 'Heat another drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add pork, ginger, and garlic. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until pork is browned and cooked through, 4-5 minutes. Add remaining soy sauce and cook, stirring, until liquid has mostly evaporated, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.', 'Fluff rice with a fork and season with salt and pepper; divide between bowls. Arrange pork and veggies on top. Top with pickled scallion whites (and pickling liquid). Drizzle with sauce and remaining sriracha to taste. Sprinkle with scallion greens and serve.']
