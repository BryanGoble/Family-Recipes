ingredients: ['2 unit Scallions', '¼ ounce Cilantro', '1 unit Shallot', '4 ounce Fresh Mozzarella', '10 ounce Pizza Dough', '2 teaspoon Olive Oil', '4 ounce Prosciutto', '1 jar Honey', '1 teaspoon Chili Flakes', '4 ounce Pineapple']

instructionTitles: ['Prep the toppings', 'Par-bake the pizza dough', 'Cook the pineapple', 'Assemble the pizza']
instructions: ['Wash and dry all produce. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Thinly slice the scallions, keeping the greens and whites separate. Roughly chop the cilantro. Peel, then thinly slice the shallot into rings. Roughly chop the pineapple into small pieces, reserving any juice. Slice or tear the mozzarella cheese into small pieces.', 'Using your hands, stretch out the dough into a rough 1/4-inch thick rectangle (about 9”x13”). Place onto a lightly oiled baking sheet and prick all over with a fork. Place in the oven for 7-10 minutes, until the dough is just beginning to brown on the edges. HINT: If you have a rolling pin or wine bottle, we recommend rolling out the dough onto a lightly floured surface.', 'While the pizza dough cooks, heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over high heat. Add the pineapple to the pan and cook, tossing for 3-4 minutes until slightly browned. Add the shallots and the scallion whites to the pan and cook for an additional 2 minutes. When the pizza dough is ready, remove it from the oven and preheat the broiler to high or the oven to 500 degrees.', 'Top the par-baked pizza dough with the mozzarella cheese, pineapple, shallot, and scallion whites. Tear the prosciutto into pieces and lay them over the pizza. Return the pizza to the oven for 3-5 more minutes, until the crust is crisp and slightly charred, and the cheese is melted and starting to brown.', 'Make the spiced honey: Add the scallion greens, reserved pineapple juice, 1 Tablespoon honey, 1 Tablespoon water, and a pinch of chili flakes (to taste) to the same pan you used for the pineapple. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat.', 'Plate and serve: Cut the Hawaiian pizza into slices and drizzle with the spiced honey. Top with the chopped cilantro and enjoy!']
