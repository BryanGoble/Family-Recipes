title: 'Chicken Bulgogi Bowls'
description: "If you’re a fan of our beef bulgogi bowl, then you’ll love this chicken rendition. It’s just as sweet, savory, tangy, and delicious—but it features crispy, pan-seared pieces of chicken instead of ground beef. The chicken is finished in the same signature sesame-and-soy-spiked concoction known as bulgogi sauce (cue the swoons). There’s also quick-pickled cucumber ribbons, tender shredded carrots, and a spicy sriracha crema all arranged over a bed of fluffy white rice. Dig in!"

In a medium bowl, combine half the vinegar (you’ll use the rest later), ½ tsp sugar (1 tsp for 4 servings), and a big pinch of salt. Trim ends from cucumber; shave lengthwise into thin ribbons using a peeler, rotating as you go. Stop once you get to the seedy core; discard core. Toss ribbons into bowl with vinegar mixture. Set aside to quick-pickle, tossing occasionally.', 'Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over mediumhigh heat. Add carrots and cook, stirring, until just tender, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a plate.', 'Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a large drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Pour in remaining vinegar. Let cook 30 seconds, then stir in bulgogi sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened, 1-2 minutes. Turn off heat. Season with salt and pepper.', 'Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine sour cream and sriracha to taste. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt.', 'Fluff rice with a fork and stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings), salt, and pepper; divide between bowls. Arrange chicken, carrots, and pickled cucumber on top. (TIP: Drain any excess liquid from cucumber before adding.) Drizzle crema over everything.']
