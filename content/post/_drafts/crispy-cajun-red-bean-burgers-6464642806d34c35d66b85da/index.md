title: 'Crispy Cajun Red Bean & Bacon Burgers'
description: "Our chefs are taking Meatless Mondays seriously with these oh-so-delicious Cajun-spiced bean patties. They’re super hearty with mashed red beans, Monterey Jack cheese, and scallions—cooked until golden brown and crispy—served on toasted brioche buns, then layered with pickles and slathered with our secret sauce. And we can’t forget about a veggie burger's BFF, a side of crispy potatoes. Get ready to ask yourself, “Who needs meat, anyway?”"

ingredients: ['12 ounce Potatoes', '1 unit Sliced Dill Pickle', '1 unit Kidney Beans', '2 unit Scallions', '4 tablespoon Mayonnaise', '1 teaspoon Hot Sauce', '¼ cup Monterey Jack Cheese', '1 teaspoon Garlic Powder', '82 g Tempura Batter', '1 tablespoon Cajun Spice Blend', '2 unit Brioche Buns', ' Salt', ' Pepper', '2 teaspoon Cooking Oil', '½ teaspoon Sugar', '2 tablespoon Butter', '4 ounce Bacon']

instructions: ['• Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Finely chop a few pickle slices until you have 2 tsp (4 tsp for 4 servings). (Save remaining pickle slices for serving.) Drain and rinse beans. Trim and mince scallions.', '• Toss potatoes on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. • Roast on top rack until golden brown and crispy, 20-25 minutes.', '• While potatoes roast, in a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, chopped pickle, ½ tsp sugar (1 tsp for 4 servings), and as much hot sauce as you like. Heat a large dry pan over medium-high heat. Add bacon; cook, turning occasionally and adjusting heat if browning too quickly, until crispy, 6-10 minutes. Turn off heat; transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. Wipe out pan.', '• Meanwhile, place half the beans (all for 4 servings) in a large bowl. Mash with a potato masher or fork until mostly smooth. (It’s OK if there are still some larger pieces.) • Stir in Monterey Jack, scallions, garlic powder, Cajun Spice Blend, ¾ of the tempura batter mix, and 3 TBSP water until thoroughly combined. (For 4, use all the tempura batter mix, and ¼ cup water.) Season with salt (we used ¼ tsp; ½ tsp for 4) and pepper. • Divide bean mixture into two mounds (four mounds for 4).', '• Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Using a rubber spatula, add bean mixture mounds to pan and gently press to flatten into patties, each about as wide as a burger bun. • Cook until golden brown and crisp, 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer patties to a plate. TIP: Depending on the size of your pan, you may need to work in batches, adding another drizzle of oil before each batch. Use pan used for bacon here.', '• Halve and toast buns until golden; spread cut sides with 2 TBSP butter (4 TBSP for 4 servings). Spread bottom buns with up to half the secret sauce. Fill buns with patties and as much sliced pickle as you like. • Divide sandwiches between plates. Serve with potato wedges and remaining secret sauce on the side. Fill buns with bacon along with patties. Bacon is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 145°.']
