title: 'Jimmy O. Yang’s Hoisin Chicken Flatbread'
description: "Get hungry for a mash-up of epic and unexpected proportions, dreamed up and perfected by none other than actor and comedian Jimmy O. Yang! For this limited-edition recipe, you’ll load savory-sweet hoisin-glazed chicken thighs onto crisp flatbreads, then sprinkle generously with shredded mozzarella (you heard us!). When the flatbreads come out melty, browned, and delicious, you’ll drizzle the tops with homemade sizzling scallion ginger oil, then top with sliced cucumber just before serving for crunchy, cool contrast."

ingredients: ['2 unit Scallions', '1 thumb Ginger', '1 unit Mini Cucumber', '10 ounce Diced Chicken Thighs', '2 tablespoon Hoisin Sauce', '4 tablespoon Sweet Soy Glaze', '2 unit Flatbreads', '½ cup Mozzarella Cheese', '1 teaspoon Sriracha', ' Salt', ' Pepper', '8 teaspoon Cooking Oil']

instructionTitles: ['Prep', 'Cook Chicken', 'Make Sizzling Oil', 'Toast Flatbreads', 'Assemble & Bake Flatbreads', 'Finish & Serve']
instructions: ['• Adjust rack to top position (top and middle positions for 4 servings) and heat broiler to high or preheat oven to 500 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Trim and mince scallions. Peel and mince or grate ginger. Trim and quarter cucumber lengthwise, then slice into ¼-inch-thick quarter-moons.', '• Pat chicken* dry with paper towels and season all over with pepper. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken in a single layer; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. • Stir in hoisin, sweet soy glaze, and 2  TBSP water (4 TBSP for 4 servings). Cook until sauce is thickened and chicken is coated, 1-2 minutes more. (Be careful—sauce may splatter a bit.)', '• Place scallions, ginger, and a pinch of salt in a medium heatproof bowl. • While chicken cooks, heat 2 TBSP oil (4 TBSP for 4 servings) in a small pan over high heat until it just starts to smoke, 1-3 minutes (we recommend keeping a close eye on the pan so you can see exactly when it begins to smoke!). • Turn off heat and carefully pour hot oil over scallion mixture. (Be sure to stand back while you pour that hot oil—mixture will sizzle!) Set aside until ready to serve.', '• Place flatbreads upside down (dimpled sides down) on a lightly oiled, foil-lined baking sheet; toast on top rack until golden brown, 1-2 minutes. (For 4 servings, divide flatbreads between 2 prepared sheets; toast on top and middle racks, swapping rack positions halfway through toasting.)', '• When flatbreads are toasted, flip over (dimpled sides up) and top with chicken, as much sauce from the pan as you like, and mozzarella. • Broil or bake flatbreads on top rack until edges are golden brown, 2-4 minutes (for 4 servings, use top and middle racks; swap rack positions halfway through). (Watch carefully so flatbreads don’t burn!) Transfer flatbreads to a cutting board.', '• Slice flatbreads into quarters; top with scallion ginger oil and cucumber. • Divide flatbreads between plates and serve with Sriracha for drizzling. Chicken is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 165°.']
