title: 'Shrimp and Asparagus Risotto'
description: "One of our favorite things about risottos is that they can breathe new life into otherwise ordinary ingredients. Like shrimp and asparagus, which in any other context might seem like the start of a crisp salad or stir-fry, but here become cozy, warm, and tender when folded into the oozy grains. To freshen things up, we’re adding a dash of Meyer lemon, the hybrid citrus fruit that’s part orange, part lemon, and all tangy deliciousness."
