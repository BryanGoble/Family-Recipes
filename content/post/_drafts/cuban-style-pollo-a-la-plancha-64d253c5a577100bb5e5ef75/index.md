description: "Inspired by members of our own HelloFresh community, we’re proud to share this delicious limited-time dish in celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month. You’ll marinate chicken in a bright, sunny blend of fresh-squeezed lime and orange juice while black beans simmer with green pepper, garlic, and cumin. Sear the chicken along with sweet onion wedges to golden brown perfection, and serve atop fluffy rice along with black beans and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro and final squeeze of lime."
