title: 'One-Pan Cheesy Chicken Tacos'
description: "We love making tacos at home so we can customize them to fit our exact craving. For this vegetarian version, we ditched the meat for a hearty filling of green pepper and spiced black beans, and two cheeses for maximum melt-factor, plus a drizzle of smoky red pepper crema. Oh, and did we mention these are ready in just 15 minutes?"
