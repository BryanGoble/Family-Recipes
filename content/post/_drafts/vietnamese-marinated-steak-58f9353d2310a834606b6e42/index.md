title: 'Vietnamese Marinated Steak'
description: "Vietnamese cuisine is known for its embrace of electric ingredients, from the nipping jolt of lime juice to the umami-rich swagger of soy sauce and the prickly heat of fresh chiles. And when you combine those forceful flavors and use them to marinate steak, as we’ve done in this recipe, sparks start flying. Each slice of tender, robust sirloin sings with vivid juices, which are matched only by the crisp acidity of the quick-pickled veggie salad on the side."

Season with salt and pepper. Divide rice between plates, then top with steak. Scatter mint mixture over top and serve with salad to the side.']
