title: 'Crispy Chipotle Shrimp Tacos'
description: "Just when you thought tacos couldn’t get any tastier, our chefs found a way to take them to the next level of piping-hot, piled-high perfection. Shrimp is pan-fried until golden and tucked away in warm corn tortillas with a citrusy red cabbage slaw. Then it’s finished with a smoky lime crema (you can call it taco special sauce). The best part, though, might be that you can get these bad boys on the table in about 20 minutes."

Rinse shrimp under cool running water and pat dry with a paper towel.', 'Toss cabbage and scallion whites in a medium bowl with a squeeze of lime, a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Set aside.', 'Heat a ¼-inch layer of oil in a large pan over high heat (use a nonstick pan if you have one). Meanwhile, place shrimp, cornstarch, and ¼ tsp chipotle powder in another medium bowl (we’ll use more chipotle in step 5). Season with salt and pepper. Toss until shrimp are thoroughly coated.', 'Add shrimp to pan in a single layer and cook until golden brown and crisp, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from pan with a slotted spoon and set aside on a paper-towel-lined plate. Season with salt and pepper.', 'In a small bowl, stir together sour cream, a squeeze of lime, and a pinch of chipotle powder (use more to taste). Season with salt and pepper. Add enough water to create a drizzly consistency (about 1 TBSP). Wrap tortillas in a lightly dampened paper towel and microwave until warm and soft, about 30 seconds.', 'Divide slaw, shrimp, and radishes between tortillas. Drizzle with crema, sprinkle with scallion greens, and serve with any remaining lime wedges for squeezing over.']
