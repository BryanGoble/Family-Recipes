title: 'Mediterranean Chicken Bowls'
description: "The Mediterranean Sea may conjure up images of calm blue shores and lazy, sunny days spent at the beach. This recipe, however, although undeniably Mediterranean in flavor, is anything but laid back. In fact, it will be in and out of your kitchen in barely any time at all—you can make it in as little as 20 minutes. All it takes is a few zaps in the microwave to warm up the stock for the couscous, followed by a little chopping for the salad and a quick sautée for the chicken."
