title: 'Cajun-Spiced Pulled Pork'
description: "Pulled pork isn’t just for low-and-slow-cooking barbecues. Our recipe is one you can make any night of the week. Really: this dish can be ready in just 20 minutes. Ready-to-heat chunks of meat are quickly tossed in the pan with Cajun spices, honey, and diced tomato. It’s all spooned over pre-steamed basmati rice studded with poblano pepper pieces, giving you a delectable combination of hot, savory, and sweet."
