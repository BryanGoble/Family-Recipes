title: 'Kimchi Hot Sauce Burritos'
description: "Burritos are the perfect vehicle for delivering the fierce flavors of kimchi sauce (that’s the spicy juice that comes with Korean pickled vegetables—it acts here like hot sauce gone wild with salty, savory flavors). The rice, black bean, carrot, and cucumber filling soaks up all that peppery goodness, delivering feistiness with each bite. On the side, you’ve also got a carrot and cucumber slaw, which doesn’t drop the ball in delivering tanginess and crunch either."
