title: 'Pan-Seared Sweet Soy Glazed Pork'
description: "When it comes to elevating a simple weeknight meal—like our dear friend, the humble pork chop—it’s all about the pan sauce! In this case, you’ll get a great sear on the pork, then coat it in a tangy-sweet soy sauce thickened with butter to glossy perfection. On the side is roasted broccoli and carrots sprinkled with fiery Korean chili flakes. Shower your plate with scallion greens before serving for a fresh, zippy crunch."
