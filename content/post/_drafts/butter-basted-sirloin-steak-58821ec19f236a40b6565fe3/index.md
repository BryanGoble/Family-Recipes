title: 'Butter-Basted Sirloin Steak'
description: "A juicy, seared steak is a sure route to maximal flavor with minimal effort. But when chefs want to really raise the steaks, they add a not-so-secret ingredient: butter. It not only delivers rich flavor, but also helps the meat achieve a beautiful, brown crust. To that end, you’ll be basting sirloin in butter, garlic, and herbs in this recipe. The sides are no slouch, either: parsnip wedges roasted until they’re sweet, plus tender spinach decked out with sour cream."

Strip rosemary leaves from stems. Discard stems and chop leaves.

Roast in oven until lightly browned, 20-25 minutes, tossing halfway through.', 'Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Season steak all over with salt and pepper.

Add remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add spinach and toss until wilted, 3-4 minutes. (TIP: Add a splash of water if you’re having trouble getting spinach to wilt.) Remove pan from heat and let cool 1 minute. Stir in sour cream. Season with salt and pepper.', 'Slice steak against the grain. Divide parsnips, steak, and spinach between plates and serve.']
