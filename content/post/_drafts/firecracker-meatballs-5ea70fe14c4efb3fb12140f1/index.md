title: 'Firecracker Meatballs'
description: "This recipe is here to blow up everything you think you know about meatballs. All dramatics aside, these meatballs are truly game-changing thanks to a certain onomatopoeic sauce. What exactly is “bang bang,” you ask? Well, mystery asker, it’s a creamy, spicy, sweet, and savory (yes, all those things!) sauce so good, it’ll make your taste buds explode! Once the meatballs are baked, they’re tossed in the magical condiment, then plated atop sesame-seed-flecked rice along with crispy roasted green beans (AKA more things to dip in sauce). Don’t be surprised when you find yourself swiping up every last drop."

instructions: ['Adjust rack to top position (top and middle positions for 4 servings) and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens; mince whites. Peel and mince ginger.', 'In a large bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, honey, 2 tsp soy sauce (4 tsp for 4 servings; you’ll use the rest later), and sriracha to taste. Set aside.', 'Heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add half the sesame seeds (you’ll use the rest later); cook, stirring, until golden brown, 1-2 minutes. Add rice, ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4 servings), and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil; cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.', 'In a second large bowl, combine beef, panko, ginger, scallion whites, remaining soy sauce, salt (we used ½ tsp; 1 tsp for 4 servings), and pepper.

Roast on top rack until meatballs are cooked through and green beans are browned and tender, 14-16 minutes. (For 4 servings, divide between 2 baking sheets; roast meatballs on middle rack and green beans on top rack.)', 'Fluff rice with a fork; season with salt and pepper. Divide between bowls or plates. To bowl with sauce, carefully add meatballs; toss to coat. Top rice with meatballs. Drizzle with any remaining sauce. Serve green beans to the side. Garnish with scallion greens, remaining sesame seeds, and chili flakes to taste.']
