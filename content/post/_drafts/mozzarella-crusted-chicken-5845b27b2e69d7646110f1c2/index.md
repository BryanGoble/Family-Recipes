title: 'Mozzarella-Crusted Chicken'
description: "Think of this recipe as a new take on chicken Parmesan. Herbs, breadcrumbs, and mozzarella are heaped onto chicken to create glorious crown of a crust. In place of marinara, roasted tomatoes add a sweet and tangy punch. On the side, you’ve also got some crispy potatoes because, hey, why not?"
