title: 'Spanish One-Pan Chicken'
description: "In Spain, paella is something of a festive dish, made for large gatherings or celebrations and almost always cooked over a wood fire. Don't tell the Spaniards, but we think it's also a pretty great, quick and easy, one-pan stovetop recipe that can be enjoyed even in cozy and intimate settings. Filled with chicken, chorizo, and bright red peppers, our version feels like a meaty, savory, flavor-filled jubilee."
