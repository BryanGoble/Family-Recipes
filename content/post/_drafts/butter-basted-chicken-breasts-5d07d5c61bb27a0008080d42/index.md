title: 'Butter-Basted Chicken Breasts'
description: "Your average chicken breast gets amped up with a rich pan sauce and flavorful sides like mashed potatoes and candied bacon Brussels sprouts. The “candied” here refers to brown sugar that’s added to the bacon, then baked to form a gorgeous caramelized layer. The dish is finished with a silky, flavor-packed pan sauce, made from garlic herb butter, our rich demi-glace, and tangy sour cream. Served with velvety mashed potatoes to bring it all together, this decadent meal is one for the books."
