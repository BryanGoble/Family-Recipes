title: 'Vietnamese Shrimp Skewers & Shaking Beef'
description: "Shake up a special dinner in honor of Asian Heritage Month with this spotlight on two classic Vietnamese dishes. Shaking beef—a steak stir-fry in a buttery, sweet-soy glaze—is named for the pan-shaking action needed during the searing step. Lemongrass BBQ shrimp is made with women-owned sauce company Omsom’s zippy lemongrass marinade, featuring Red Boat fish sauce and lots of garlic and aromatics. In true Vietnamese style, you’ll serve these umami bombs with a refreshing contrast: crisp, cool, and tangy-sweet cucumber salad, garnished with crunchy peanuts and fragrant fresh cilantro."

instructions: ['• Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry produce. Place skewers in a shallow dish and cover with water to soak. • Peel garlic; thinly slice one clove (two cloves for 4 servings). Mince remaining garlic. Halve cucumber lengthwise; slice into ½-inch-thick half-moons. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion. Roughly chop peanuts. Roughly chop cilantro, reserving 2-3 whole sprigs for garnish.', '• Rinse shrimp* under cold water, then pat dry with paper towels. Place shrimp in a medium bowl. Add half the lemongrass marinade and 1 tsp sugar (2 tsp for 4 servings). Season with salt and toss to combine. • Pat steak* dry with paper towels. Cut steak into 1-inch cubes. Season all over with salt and pepper.', '• Heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. • Stir in rice, 1¼ cups water (2½ cups for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until tender, 15-18 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.', '• In a second medium bowl, combine cucumber, carrots, two packets of vinegar (four packets for 4 servings), 1½ tsp sugar (3 tsp for 4), and a pinch of salt. Stir to coat; set aside to pickle, stirring occasionally.', '• Thread marinated shrimp onto skewers (4-5 shrimp per skewer); discard marinade in bowl. • Place shrimp skewers on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Roast on top rack for 4 minutes. • Remove from oven and spoon remaining lemongrass marinade over skewers. • Return to top rack and roast until shrimp are opaque and fully cooked, 4-5 minutes more. • GRILL PAN ALTERNATIVE: Heat a drizzle of oil in a large grill pan over medium-high heat. Add shrimp skewers; cook until shrimp begin to brown, 2-3 minutes. Flip, then brush with remaining lemongrass marinade. Cook until opaque and fully cooked, 2-3 minutes more.', '• Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring, until beginning to brown, 2-3 minutes. Push to one side of pan. • Heat another drizzle of oil in empty side of pan. Add steak cubes and sear until beginning to brown on one side, 2-3 minutes (stir onion occasionally as you sear beef). Flip steak cubes and cook 1 minute more. • Add sliced garlic, sweet soy glaze, and remaining vinegar; stir entire contents of pan to combine. Cook until steak is cooked to desired doneness, 1-2 minutes. • Remove pan from heat. Stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings). Season to taste with salt and pepper.', '• Fluff rice with a fork. Divide rice between plates. TIP: To get a perfect mound of rice, spray the insides of 2 small bowls with nonstick spray and pack with rice. Carefully invert bowls onto plates and slowly lift bowls away. • Top rice with beef. Serve cucumber salad and shrimp skewers alongside rice and beef. Garnish with peanuts, chopped cilantro, and whole cilantro sprigs. Shrimp are fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 145°. Steak is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 145°.']
