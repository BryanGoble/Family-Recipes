title: 'Honey-Glazed Pork Tenderloin'
description: "A honey glaze may sound like something that goes with dessert, but mild-tasting pork loves a sweet sauce. And you seem to love it, too: last time, our home cooks were so blown away by this recipe that we’ve decided to add it to the HelloFresh Hall of Fame. You’ll be drizzling that glaze onto pork tenderloin—and the roasted sweet potatoes and green beans, if you like, too, because it’s just too good to not slather it on everything."

Roast until tender, 20-25 minutes (we’ll check in after 10 minutes).', 'Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Pat pork dry with a paper towel.

Strip 2 tsp thyme leaves from stems.', 'After sweet potatoes have roasted 10 minutes, remove from oven and toss, keeping toward one side of sheet. Add green beans to other side and toss with a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper.

Roast in oven to desired doneness, 8-12 minutes.', 'Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for pork over medium heat. Add garlic and thyme. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in stock concentrates, ¼ cup water, and honey. Scrape up any browned bits from bottom of pan. Simmer until reduced by half, 3-4 minutes. Add 1 TBSP butter and stir to melt. Season with salt and pepper.', 'Let pork rest 2-3 minutes after removing from oven, then thinly slice. Divide green beans and sweet potatoes between plates, then top with pork. Drizzle with glaze and serve. TIP: If glaze seems stiff, stir in a splash or two of water first.']
