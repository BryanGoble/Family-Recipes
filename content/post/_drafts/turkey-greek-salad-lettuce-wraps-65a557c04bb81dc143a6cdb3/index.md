title: 'Turkey & Greek Salad Lettuce Wraps'
description: "There’s just something so satisfying about a lettuce wrap. The crisp romaine crunch, the perfectly cradled filling, and that satisfied-but-not-stuffed feeling after dinner. This version features ground turkey seasoned with Turkish-inspired spices, garlic, and soy sauce, then topped with fresh cucumber, tomato, red onion, feta, and a sweet and herby Greek vinaigrette. Prepare to start raving about lettuce wraps as much as we do!"
