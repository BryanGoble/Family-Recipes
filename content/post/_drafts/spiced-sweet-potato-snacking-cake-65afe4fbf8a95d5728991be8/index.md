title: 'Spiced Sweet Potato Snacking Cake'
description: "Sweet potato takes the place of carrots in this fluffy cake packed with warming spices, oats, and pecans. Enjoy it on its own for a quick and tasty breakfast, or serve it with sweet, buttery maple-raisin apple compote and a drizzle of lemony crème fraîche to create an inventive dessert for a crowd (can you say “leftovers for days?”). The best part? We called it “snack cake” so you can have a slice any time you like!"

instructions: ['• Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 400 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Peel and dice sweet potato into 1-inch pieces. Halve, core, and dice apples into ½-inch pieces. Zest and halve lemon. • Coat an 8-by-8-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray (9-by-13-inch baking dish for 12 servings).', '• In a medium microwave-safe bowl, combine sweet potato, 1 tsp salt, and 1 tsp water (2 tsp salt and 2 tsp water for 12 servings); cover with plastic wrap. Microwave in 2-minute intervals, until sweet potato is softened, 4-6 minutes. TIP: If sweet potato is still firm, continue to cook in 1 minute intervals until soft. • Add 2 TBSP butter (4 TBSP for 12) and mash until slightly smooth (it’s okay if some lumps remain!). Place in refrigerator to cool, 5-7 minutes.', '• Meanwhile, place 4 TBSP butter and 2 tsp Warming Spice Blend (8 TBSP butter and 4 tsp Warming Spice for 12 servings) in a large microwave-safe bowl. (Be sure to measure the Warming Spice Blend—we sent more!) Cover with plastic wrap and microwave in 30-second intervals, until melted, 1-2 minutes. Stir to combine. • Add mashed cooled sweet potato, sour cream, and ½ cup white sugar (1 cup for 12) to bowl; whisk until well combined. • Whisk in eggs*, one at a time, until smooth.', '• In a second medium bowl, combine flour, oats, pecans, half the baking powder, and 1 tsp salt (all the baking powder and 2 tsp salt for 12). • Transfer flour mixture to bowl with sweet potato mixture; mix until just combined. • Pour batter into prepared baking dish. • Bake on top rack until cake is springy to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25-30 minutes.', '• While cake bakes, in a small bowl, combine raisins, juice from lemon, and ¼ cup water (⅓ cup for 12 servings). • Cover with plastic wrap; microwave until raisins soften, 45-60 seconds. Set aside.', '• In a large pan, melt 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 12 servings) over medium heat. Add apples, cornstarch, brown sugar, and ¼ tsp salt (½ tsp for 12); cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30-60 seconds. • Add softened raisins and their liquid; cook, stirring occasionally, until apples are tender and glossy, 3-5 minutes. • Remove from heat. Stir in maple syrup and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 12) until butter is melted and mixture is well combined.', '• In a second small bowl, combine crème fraîche with as much lemon zest as you like. • Once cake is done, let cool for 10 minutes. Cut cake into 12 pieces to serve (you’ll have 24 pieces for 12 servings). • Divide cake between plates; top with apple compote and lemony crème fraîche. Refrigerate any remaining cake, covered, for up to 5 days. Wash hands and surfaces after handling raw eggs. Consuming raw or undercooked eggs may increase your risk of foodborne illness.']
