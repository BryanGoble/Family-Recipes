instructionTitles: ['Preheat and prep', 'Roast Zucchini', 'Start risotto', 'Simmer rice', 'Cook shrimp', 'Serve']
instructions: ['Wash and dry all produce. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a small pot, bring stock concentrate and 4 cups water to a simmer over low heat. Halve, peel, and finely dice onion. Cut zucchini into ½-inch cubes. Mince or grate garlic. Zest and halve lemon.', 'Toss zucchini on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast until lightly browned, about 20 minutes, tossing halfway through.', 'Meanwhile, heat 1 TBSP butter in a large pan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until softened, 5-6 minutes, tossing occasionally. Season with salt and pepper. Add rice and toss until grains are translucent, 1-2 minutes. Add entire bunch of thyme to pan.', 'Add stock to pan ¼ cup at a time, stirring after each addition. Allow rice to absorb stock before adding more.
