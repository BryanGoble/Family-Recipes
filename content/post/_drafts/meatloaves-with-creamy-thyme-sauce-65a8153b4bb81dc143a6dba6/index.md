title: 'Meatloaves with Creamy Thyme Sauce'
description: "This delicious dish is the definition of umami. Not sure if you’ve ever experienced the “fifth taste?” After one bite of these shallot-infused mini meatloaves, draped in a supremely savory thyme sauce, you’ll understand the obsession. The luxe loaves are served alongside crispy roasted Brussels sprouts and garlicky mashed potatoes—more ways to catch any runaway sauce. Plus, the whole shebang cooks up in just 35 minutes! What are you waiting for?"

ingredients: ['1 unit Shallot', '12 ounce Potatoes', '10 ounce Ground Beef', '¼ cup Panko Breadcrumbs', '1 teaspoon Garlic Powder', '8 ounce Brussels Sprouts', '¼ ounce Thyme', '1 unit Beef Stock Concentrate', '3 tablespoon Sour Cream', '1 tablespoon Cooking Oil', '2 tablespoon Butter', ' Salt', ' Pepper', '8 ounce Broccoli Florets']

instructionTitles: ['Start Prep & Cook Potatoes', 'Form Meatloaves', 'Roast Loaves & Sprouts', 'Finish Prep & Make Sauce', 'Mash Potatoes', 'Serve']
instructions: ['• Adjust rack to top position (middle and top positions for 4 servings) and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Dice potatoes into ½-inch pieces. Halve and peel shallot; thinly slice one half and mince remaining. Trim and halve Brussels sprouts lengthwise. • Place potatoes in a large pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, 15-20 minutes. • Reserve ½ cup potato cooking liquid, then drain and return potatoes to pot. Cut broccoli into bite-size pieces if necessary. (Save Brussels sprouts for another use.)', '• While potatoes cook, in a large bowl, combine beef*, panko, minced shallot, half the garlic powder (you’ll use the rest later), and 1 TBSP water (2 TBSP for 4 servings); season generously with salt and pepper. • Form mixture into two 1-inch-tall loaves (four loaves for 4).', '• Place meatloaves on one side of a lightly oiled baking sheet. TIP: Line sheet with foil first for easier cleanup. • Toss Brussels sprouts on empty side with a drizzle of oil; season generously with salt and pepper. • Roast on top rack until meatloaves are cooked through and Brussels sprouts are browned and tender, 15-20 minutes. (For 4 servings, use 2 baking sheets; roast meatloaves on middle rack and Brussels sprouts on top rack.) TIP: If Brussels sprouts finish first, remove from sheet and continue roasting meatloaves. Swap in broccoli for Brussels sprouts.', '• While everything roasts, strip thyme leaves from stems; finely chop leaves until you have ½ tsp (1 tsp for 4 servings). • Heat a drizzle of oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add chopped thyme and sliced shallot; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until softened, 2-4 minutes. • Stir in stock concentrate and ¼ cup water (1/3 cup for 4). Bring to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer. Cook until slightly thickened, 2-3 minutes. • Turn off heat. Stir in half the sour cream (you’ll use the rest in the next step) and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4) until melted and combined. Season with salt and pepper.', '• Heat pot with drained potatoes over low heat; add remaining sour cream, remaining garlic powder, and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings). • Mash until smooth and creamy, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as needed. Season with salt and pepper.', '• If necessary, reheat pan with sauce over low heat; stir until warmed through. • Divide meatloaves, mashed potatoes, and Brussels sprouts between plates. Spoon sauce over meatloaves and serve. Ground Beef is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160º.']
