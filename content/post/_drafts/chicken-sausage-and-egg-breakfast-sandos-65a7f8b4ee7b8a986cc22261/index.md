There’s also a side of crispy roasted potato wedges—no sandwich without sides in our kitchens!

instructionTitles: []
instructions: ['Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry produce. Quarter bell pepper lengthwise; remove stem and seeds. Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Halve buns.', 'Place bell pepper quarters on one side of a baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tsp oil and rub to coat; arrange cut sides down. Toss potato wedges on empty side of sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast on top rack until browned and softened, 18-20 minutes.', 'In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, and ½ tsp paprika (save the rest for another use).', 'Form sausage* into two equal-sized balls. TIP: When forming the balls, splash a little cold water on your hands to prevent sticking! Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Once pan is very hot, add sausage balls. Using a spatula, firmly flatten each ball to create very thin patties. Cook until browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side. In the last minute of cooking, top with gouda and cover pan until cheese melts. Turn off heat; transfer patties to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm. Wipe out pan.', 'Melt 1 TBSP butter in same pan over medium heat. Once pan is hot, crack eggs* into pan and cover. Fry eggs to preference. Season with salt and pepper. While eggs cook, toast buns until golden.', 'Spread a thin layer of smoky paprika mayo onto cut sides of toasted buns. Fill buns with bell pepper, cheesy patties, and fried eggs. Divide sandwiches and potato wedges between plates. Serve with any remaining smoky paprika mayo on the side.  Chicken Sausage is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 165°. Wash hands and surfaces after handling raw eggs. Consuming raw or undercooked eggs may increase your risk of foodborne illness']
