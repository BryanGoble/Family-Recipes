title: 'Crunchy Garden Wraps'
description: "This is a ten-minute, fresh and crunchy, wrap-and-go wonder lunch! First order of business: bang bang dressing! It’s a sweet-hot combo of Sriracha, apricot jam, mayo, olive oil, and lemon—one of those sauces that’s so easy to make (and impossible to resist!) You’ll use it to dress a spinach, scallion, and cabbage slaw, then wrap it all up in a soft flour tortilla with crisp, lemony cucumber. Serve leftover bang bang salad on the side to complete a lunch idea that’s anything but garden-variety."
