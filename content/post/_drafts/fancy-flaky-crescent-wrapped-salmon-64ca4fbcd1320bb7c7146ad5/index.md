title: 'Fancy & Flaky Crescent-Wrapped Salmon'
description: "This juicy salmon wrapped in a crisp, golden-brown pastry shell is quick enough for a weeknight but impressive enough for a weekend dinner party or other special occasion. Simply spread salmon with Dijon mustard, then wrap it in pastry dough. While it bakes to a rich, flaky finish, you’ll whip up a tangy cream sauce with shallot, dill, and lemon zest to drizzle over the top. And for sides, there are roasted carrots sprinkled with herbaceous fresh dill, and a bright lemony mixed green salad with shallot and nutty sliced almonds."

ingredients: ['12 ounce Carrots', '1 unit Shallot', '¼ ounce Dill', '1 unit Lemon', '10 ounce Skin-on Salmon', '4 ounce Pillsbury™ Original Crescent Rolls', '1 tablespoon Flour', '4 teaspoon Dijon Mustard', '2 tablespoon Crème Fraîche', '2 ounce Mixed Greens', '½ ounce Sliced Almonds', ' Salt', ' Pepper', '1 tablespoon Cooking Oil', '1 tablespoon Olive Oil']

instructionTitles: ['Prep & Start Carrots', 'Prep Dough', 'Assemble Salmon', 'Finish Salmon & Carrots', 'Mix Sauce', 'Toss Salad', 'Fiinish & Serve']
instructions: ['• Adjust rack to top position (top and middle positions for 4 servings) and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into ½-inch-thick pieces. Roughly chop dill. Halve, peel, and mince half the shallot (all for 4). Zest and quarter lemon. • Toss carrots on one side of a baking sheet with a large drizzle of oil, a pinch of salt, and pepper. (Spread carrots across entire baking sheet for 4.) Roast on top rack for 10 minutes. (You’ll add more to the sheet in Step 4.)', '• Unroll Pillsbury™️ Original Crescent Rolls on a floured work surface; separate into two rectangles (you’ll have four rectangles for 4 servings), keeping the short sides facing you. TIP: The rectangles will be perforated—keep them together as best you can. • Using a rolling pin, roll each dough rectangle until ⅛ inch thick, pinching the diagonal seam together and rolling over it to seal.', '• Pat salmon* dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper. • Using the back of a spoon, evenly spread Dijon over dough rectangles. Place salmon horizontally, skin sides up, in the center of each rectangle. • Carefully fold top and bottom edges of dough over salmon, leaving ends open.', '• Once carrots have roasted 10 minutes, remove sheet from oven. Lightly coat seam sides of wrapped salmon with oil (a pastry brush works great here!). • Place wrapped salmon, seam sides down and at least 2 inches apart, on opposite side of baking sheet. (For 4 servings, leave carrots roasting; place salmon on a second baking sheet and roast on middle rack.) • Return to top rack and roast until salmon is cooked through, pastry is golden brown, and carrots are tender, 10-12 minutes more.', '• Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine crème fraîche, half the dill, 1 TBSP minced shallot (2 TBSP for 4 servings), and as much lemon zest as you like. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. • Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Refrigerate until ready to serve.', '• In a large bowl, whisk together juice from half the lemon, 1 TBSP olive oil (2 TBSP for 4 servings), a pinch of salt, and pepper. • Add mixed greens, almonds, and remaining minced shallot; toss until well coated.', '• Divide salmon, carrots, and salad between plates. • Sprinkle remaining dill over carrots. Top salmon with creamy dill sauce; squeeze remaining lemon wedges over top. Serve. Salmon is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 145°.']
