instructionTitles: ['Prep & Make Sauce', 'Cook Pork', 'Microwave Beans & Rice', 'Finish & Serve']
instructions: ['• Wash and dry all produce.  • Trim green beans if necessary, then halve crosswise. (TIP: To do this quickly, line up several beans and slice at once.) Quarter lime.  • In a small bowl, whisk together ¾ cup cold water (1¼ cups for 4 servings) and cornstarch until dissolved. Whisk in hoisin, soy sauce, a big squeeze of lime juice to taste, and as much sriracha as you like.', '• Heat a drizzle of oil in a medium, preferably nonstick, pan (use a large pan for 4 servings) over medium-high heat. Add pork* and cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned, 3-5 minutes (it’ll finish cooking in step 4).', '• Meanwhile, place green beans in a medium microwave-safe bowl with a splash of water. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap; microwave until green beans are slightly tender, 1-2 minutes. Set aside.  • Partially open top of rice package; microwave for 90 seconds.', '• Carefully drain green beans, then add to pan with pork. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until pork is cooked through and beans are just tender, 2-3 minutes. • Pour in sauce; bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of pan. Reduce to a low simmer and cook until thickened, 2-3 minutes more. Turn off heat. • Divide rice between bowls and top with stir-fry. Sprinkle with peanuts and serve with any remaining lime wedges on the side.']
