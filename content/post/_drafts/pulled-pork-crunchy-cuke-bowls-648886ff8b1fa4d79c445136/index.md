title: 'Pulled Pork & Crunchy Cuke Bowls'
description: "This 10-minute lunch idea comes together in a flash thanks to quick, delicious pre-cooked pulled pork that you’ll brown in a pan till hot and crisp on the edges. But that’s just one element of this dreamy bowl—there’s also crunchy, tangy quick-pickled cucumber for cool contrast, a spicy Sriracha mayo drizzle, and crisp scallion greens all over fluffy rice for an envy-worthy midday meal."

instructionTitles: []
instructions: ['• Gently massage rice in package to break up grains. Partially open package and microwave according to package instructions, 90 seconds. Fluff with a fork. TIP: To make fluffing easier, transfer to a small bowl first.', '• Wash and dry produce.', '• Thinly slice cucumber into rounds. Thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.', '• In a small bowl, combine cucumber, vinegar, a pinch of sugar (we used ¼ tsp; ½ tsp for 4 servings), salt, and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave until sugar dissolves, 15-30 seconds. Stir and set aside to pickle.', '• In a second small bowl, combine mayonnaise, Sriracha, and 2 tsp water (4 tsp for 4 servings).', '• Place pulled pork* in a medium bowl; shred into bite-size pieces using your hands or 2 forks. TIP: Using your hands is much faster.', '• Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Add pulled pork and Fry Seasoning; cook, stirring occasionally, until warmed through, 2-3 minutes. (No stove available? In a large bowl, combine pulled pork, Fry Seasoning, and scallion whites. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and microwave until warmed through, 2-3 minutes.)', '• Divide rice between bowls. Top with pulled pork, pickled cucumber (draining first), and scallion greens. Drizzle with as much Sriracha mayo as you like and serve. Pulled Pork is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160°.']
