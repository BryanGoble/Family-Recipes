title: 'Mediterranean Skillet Chicken'
description: "Paella is a traditional Spanish dish made with fluffy yellow rice. However, in this recipe, our chefs opted for tender, chewy bulgur as their grain of choice. It’s cooked with sweet apricots, colorful veggies, and a dusting of bright lemon zest for a deliciously floral aroma."

Remove from pan and set aside.', 'Start the bulgur paella: In same pan, heat another drizzle of olive oil over medium heat. Add onions and toss until softened, 2-3 minutes.
