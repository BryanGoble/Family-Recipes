This 15-minute lunch (+ 15 minute snack) is the perfect make-ahead lunchbox time-saver: a kid-approved saucy meatball and rice bowl complete with cucumber, orange slices, and grapes—to stay or to go! But that’s not all—it’ll be snack time before you know it! Serve up buttery cinnamon-sugar pretzel bites with a peachy yogurt dipping sauce. That’s right: We’re thinking outside the lunchbox (so you don’t have to!).  "
