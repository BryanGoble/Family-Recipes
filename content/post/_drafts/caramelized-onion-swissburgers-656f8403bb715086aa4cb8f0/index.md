title: 'Caramelized Onion Swissburgers'
description: "Looking to up your burger game? This version will blow your mind. The savory beef patties are seared until browned, topped with melty Swiss cheese and buttery caramelized onion, and stuffed into toasted potato buns. Of course, no burger would be complete without a decadent sauce—this one combines mayo, roasted garlic, and horseradish paste to create a punchy spread. Pro tip: The aioli also goes great with the crispy potato wedges on the side."

ingredients: ['12 ounce Potatoes', '1 clove Garlic', '1 unit Onion', '1 tablespoon Fry Seasoning', '10 ounce Ground Beef', '2 slice Swiss Cheese', '4 tablespoon Mayonnaise', '1 teaspoon Spicy Horseradish Paste', '2 unit Potato Buns', ' Salt', ' Pepper', '5 teaspoon Cooking Oil', '1 teaspoon Sugar']

instructionTitles: ['Prep', 'Roast Potatoes & Garlic', 'Caramelize Onion', 'Form & Cook Patties', 'Make Aioli & Toast Buns', 'Serve']
instructions: ['• Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Peel garlic and place in the center of a small piece of foil; drizzle with oil and season with salt. Cinch into a packet. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion.', '• Toss potatoes on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, half the Fry Seasoning (you’ll use the rest later), salt, and pepper. Place garlic foil packet on same sheet. • Roast on top rack until potatoes are browned and crispy and garlic is softened, 20-25 minutes for potatoes and 15-20 minutes for garlic.', '• Meanwhile, heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and softened, 8-10 minutes. • Stir in 1 tsp sugar (2 tsp for 4 servings) and a splash of water; cook until onion is caramelized and jammy, 2-3 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. • Turn off heat; transfer to a medium bowl. Wipe out pan.', '• While onion cooks, in a large bowl, combine beef*, remaining Fry Seasoning, salt (we used ¾ tsp; 1½ tsp for 4 servings), and pepper. • Form into two patties (four patties for 4), each slightly wider than a burger bun. • Once onion is done, heat a drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add patties and cook to desired doneness, 3-5 minutes per side. • In the last 1-2 minutes of cooking, top patties with Swiss cheese; cover pan to melt cheese.', '• While patties cook, carefully unwrap foil packet; mash roasted garlic with a fork or finely chop. • In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, roasted garlic, and horseradish paste to taste. (TIP: Start with half the horseradish paste, then taste and add more from there if you like.) Season with salt and pepper. • Halve and toast buns.', '• Spread bottom buns with as much aioli as you like (save a bit for dipping if desired). Fill buns with patties and caramelized onion. • Divide burgers and potato wedges between plates. Serve any remaining aioli on the side. TIP: If you have ketchup on hand, serve some on the side for dipping. Ground beef is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160°.']
