title: 'Smoky BBQ Chicken Sandwiches'
description: "For this easy, satisfying lunch, bring your favorite summertime memories to the table—the smell of barbecue wafting through the warm evening air, crickets chirping in the background…we’ll let you take it from there. You’ll sprinkle juicy, fully cooked chicken breasts with rich BBQ seasoning, zap ’em in the microwave, then tuck them into toasted potato buns spread with tangy hot sauce-spiked mayo. Top with crisp dill pickle slices and fresh tomato slices for color and crunch and enjoy that cookout vibe in 10 minutes, flat."
