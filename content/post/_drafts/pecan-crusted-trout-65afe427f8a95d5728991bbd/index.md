title: 'Pecan-Crusted Trout'
description: "What's better than tender, buttery fish with a crunchy, nutty topping? How about steelhead trout fillets coated in a creamy honey mustard sauce, crusted in a mixture of crushed pecans, panko, fresh thyme, and butter? The topping turns toasty and crispy in the oven as the fish cooks to juicy perfection. On the side, we’re serving up thyme-roasted potato rounds and mixed greens with apple. Weeknight luxury is just 35 minutes away!"

instructions: ['• Adjust racks to top and middle positions and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Cut potatoes into ¼-inch-thick rounds. Strip thyme leaves from stems; roughly chop leaves until you have 2 tsp. Finely chop pecans or crush in their bag with a heavy-bottomed pan or rolling pin.', '• Lightly oil a baking sheet. Toss potatoes on sheet with a drizzle of oil, half the chopped thyme, salt, and pepper. • Roast on top rack for 12 minutes (you’ll start the trout then).', '• While potatoes roast, place 2 TBSP butter (3 TBSP for 4 servings) in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave until melted, 30 seconds. Let cool slightly, then stir in pecans, panko, remaining chopped thyme, and a pinch of salt and pepper. • In a small bowl, combine honey, mustard, and mayonnaise.', '• Pat trout* dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle skin sides with oil; rub to coat. • Once potatoes have roasted 12 minutes, place trout, skin sides down, on a second baking sheet. Reserve half the honey mustard sauce in a second small bowl for serving; evenly spread tops with a thin layer of remaining honey mustard sauce. Mound tops with pecan mixture, pressing firmly to adhere. • Transfer potatoes to middle rack and place trout on top rack. Roast until trout is cooked through, pecan crust is golden brown, and potatoes are golden brown, 10-12 minutes.', '• Meanwhile, halve, core, and thinly slice apple. Quarter lemon. • In a large bowl, combine mixed greens, apple, a large drizzle of olive oil, and as much lemon juice as you like. Season with salt and pepper.', '• Divide trout, potatoes, and salad between plates. Drizzle trout with reserved honey mustard sauce and serve. Trout is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 145°.']
