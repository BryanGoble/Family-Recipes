title: 'Argentine Chimichurri Steak'
description: "Argentinians love their beef—their asados (barbecues) are practically celebrations of the meat. Head to one and you’ll likely find a nicely seared steak accompanied by a communal bowl of chimichurri—a drizzly herb sauce with a pinch of tartness and heat. Although we can’t send you the experience of dining al fresco in picturesque Patagonia, we can give you this recipe that, along with a roasted veggie jumble, recreates those incredible flavors."
