title: 'Sweet Chili Beef & Cabbage Stir-Fry'
description: "Falling into a stir-fry rut with the same veggie + sauce combo each week? We’ve got you covered. This version features garlicky ground pork, which is simmered in a sweet, savory, and spicy blend of soy, ponzu, Thai chili sauce, and rice wine vinegar. It’s tossed with tender sautéed cabbage, then spooned over jasmine rice and garnished with crispy fried onions. The best part? It takes just 20 minutes from start to finish—now that’s what we call a winning dinner."
