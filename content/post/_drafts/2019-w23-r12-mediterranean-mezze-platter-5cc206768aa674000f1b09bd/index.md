This mezze platter is perfect for the indecisive (or extra-hungry) eater, and if we’re being honest, isn’t that all of us?? Each flavorful component makes up one dynamically delicious meal. Our mezze has spiced chicken, a fresh tomato and cucumber salad, lemony couscous, creamy, zingy tzatziki, garlic butter-toasted pita, and spice-crusted grilling cheese. Dip, mix, and match bites to your heart’s desire. Now all you need is a glass of red wine—it’s heart healthy, after all!"
