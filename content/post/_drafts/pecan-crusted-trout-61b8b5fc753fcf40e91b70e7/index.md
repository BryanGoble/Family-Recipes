title: 'Pecan-Crusted Trout'
description: "There’s nothing nuts about wanting pecan-crusted everything—other than the nuts, of course! Our chefs took this to the next level, coating steelhead trout fillets in a creamy honey mustard sauce, then crusting them in a mixture of crushed pecans, panko, fresh thyme, and butter. The topping turns toasty and crispy in the oven as the fish cooks to juicy deliciousness. We’re also serving up thyme-roasted potato rounds and mixed greens with apple slices, because you deserve a full, top-notch weeknight meal."

Let cool slightly, then stir in pecans, panko, remaining chopped thyme, and a pinch of salt and pepper. • In a small bowl, combine honey, mustard, and mayonnaise.', '• Pat trout* dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper. Drizzle skin sides with oil; rub to coat. • Once potatoes have roasted 12 minutes, place trout skin sides down on a second baking sheet. Evenly spread tops with a thin layer of honey mustard sauce (save remaining sauce for serving); mound with pecan mixture, pressing firmly to adhere. • Transfer potatoes to middle rack and place trout on top rack. Roast until crust is golden brown and trout is cooked through, 10-12 minutes.', '• Meanwhile, halve, core, and thinly slice apple.
