title: 'Black Bean and Poblano Flautas'
description: "When it comes to Mexican food, tacos typically get all the glory. In our opinion, flautas are an unsung dinner hero. They’re technically just crispy, rolled-up tacos—but they’re really so much more than that. Seriously, what could be better than warm, crunchy tortillas stuffed with all kinds of delicious fillings? Ours boast stewed and mashed black beans, diced poblano, and jalapeño-flecked pepper jack. They’re then pan fried until deeply golden and topped with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, and hot sauce."

instructions: ['Wash and dry all produce. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion. Core, deseed, and dice poblano into ½-inch pieces. Drain beans over a small bowl, reserving liquid. Finely dice tomato. Trim and thinly slice scallions. Halve lime. In a separate small bowl, combine tomato, scallions, a large squeeze of lime juice, and a drizzle of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.', 'Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add poblano and onion; cook until just softened, 5-6 minutes. Add Southwest Spice and half the beans. Cook, stirring, until fragrant and warmed through, 2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove pan from heat.', 'Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add remaining beans and cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. Add ¼ cup reserved bean liquid (½ cup for 4 servings). Let simmer until warmed through, 1-2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir in 1 TBSP butter. Remove pot from heat, then mash beans with a potato masher or fork until mostly smooth. Season with plenty of salt and pepper.', 'Spread tortillas with mashed beans. Place a small amount of filling on one half of each tortilla, then sprinkle with pepper jack. Roll up tortillas, starting with filled side, and place seam sides down on a plate.', 'Wash out pan used for filling. Heat a large drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Place flautas seam sides down in pan. Cook, carefully turning so they stay intact, until golden brown and crispy, 1-2 minutes per side. TIP: Work in batches if necessary and watch carefully to avoid burning.', 'Divide flautas between plates and top with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, and hot sauce. Alternatively, serve with toppings on the side for dipping.']
