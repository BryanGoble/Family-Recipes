title: '"Little Ears" Pasta'
description: "The backbone of this quick and easy dinner is orecchiette—a round-shaped pasta named for the “little ears” they resemble. It’s traditionally associated with Apulia, the southern Italian region from which we drew our inspiration for this recipe. The pasta is tossed with bites of baby broccoli and sweet sausage, then given a nice coating of basil-packing pesto and Parmesan cheese."

Toss until everything is well-coated and a thick sauce has formed, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.', 'Divide orecchiette mixture between plates.
