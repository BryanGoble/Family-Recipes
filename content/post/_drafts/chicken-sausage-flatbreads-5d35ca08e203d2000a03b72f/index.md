description: "Put down the phone for delivery: this dinner is all about creating a masterful flatbread on your own terms. You’ll practice topping the base with layers of tomato sauce, cheese, and sausage. And because a little bit of green is always a plus, there are slices of zucchini and some fresh oregano, too. All these ingredients work together to deliver a baked masterpiece that will keep you by the oven door, anticipating the moment of peak meltiness."
