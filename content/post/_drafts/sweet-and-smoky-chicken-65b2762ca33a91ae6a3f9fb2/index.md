title: 'Sweet & Smoky Chicken'
description: "If you’re craving something that’s good and hearty, this recipe has got you covered. Pork filet is rubbed with cinnamon and smoked paprika, which brings a layer of warm aromatics to the meat. It’s then roasted and drizzled in a cherry jam sauce that adds sweetness to all that savory. The mashed potatoes on the side stay creamy and classic, but there are also tender roasted carrots with a sprinkle of chili flakes for a pop of heat."

Wash and dry produce. • Peel and cut carrots on a diagonal into ½-inch pieces.', '• Dice potatoes into ½-inch pieces; place in a large pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, 15-20 minutes. • Reserve ½ cup potato cooking liquid, then drain and return potatoes to pot. • Keep covered off heat until ready to mash.', '•Meanwhile, toss carrots on one side of a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper.

(Reserve remaining spice mixture in bowl for the next step.) • Once carrots have roasted for 5 minutes, remove sheet from oven. Carefully place pork on empty side of sheet. (For 4, leave carrots roasting; add pork to a second sheet and roast on top rack.) • Roast until pork is cooked through and carrots are browned and tender, 18-20 minutes more. Transfer pork to a cutting board to rest.', '•While pork roasts, add jam and 1 tsp vinegar (1½ tsp for 4 servings) to bowl with reserved spice mixture; stir to combine.
