title: 'Sirloin in a Mushroom Sauce'
description: "Our sirloin steak has such a deep, rich, and gloriously meaty flavor that it could be a stand-alone dish with little more than salt and pepper for seasoning. But we’re still adding some top-notch sides and a full-bodied sauce to this recipe so that it soars above and beyond. Ultra-creamy mashed potatoes and tender roasted carrots make it filling and hearty, while the mushroom pan sauce that’s spooned on top has savory complexity."
