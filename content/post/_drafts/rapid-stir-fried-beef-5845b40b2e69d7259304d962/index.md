title: 'Rapid Stir-Fried Beef'
description: "One of the great things about Asian-style stir-fries is that they deliver maximum flavor in a snap. In this recipe, we’re tossing the classic combo of beef and broccoli with bouncy noodles and dressing them in a savory soy and hoisin-based sauce. It comes together so swiftly in the pan, it might even be easier than picking up the phone for takeout!"
