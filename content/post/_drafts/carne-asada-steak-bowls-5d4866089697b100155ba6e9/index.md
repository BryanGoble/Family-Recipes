title: 'Carne Asada Steak Bowls'
description: "There are few things more satisfying than steak for dinner. Until now! These carne-loaded bowls are hearty, filling, and most of all—absolutely delicious. Tender bites of seared, Southwest-spiced steak are piled atop fluffy lime rice along with fresh tomato salsa, Monterey Jack cheese, and zingy pickled jalapeño. For a finishing touch, the bowls are topped with avocado crema. One bite will have you bowled over."

ingredients: ['2 unit Scallions', '¾ cup Jasmine Rice', '1 unit Roma Tomato', '1 unit Lime', '1 unit Jalapeño', '4 tablespoon Guacamole', '2 tablespoon Sour Cream', '10 ounce Diced Steak', '1 tablespoon Southwest Spice Blend', '¼ cup Monterey Jack Cheese', '1 tablespoon Butter', '1 teaspoon Vegetable Oil', ' Salt', ' Pepper', '½ teaspoon Sugar']

instructionTitles: ['Prep and Cook Rice', 'Make Salsa', 'PICKLE JALAPEÑO', 'Make Avocado Crema', 'Cook Steak', 'Finish and Serve']
instructions: ['Wash and dry all produce. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Melt 1 TBSP butter in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites and cook, stirring, until softened, 1-2 minutes. Stir in rice, 1¼ cups water (2¼ cups for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.', 'Dice tomato. Zest and quarter lime. In a small bowl, combine tomato, scallion greens, a squeeze of lime juice, and half the lime zest. Season with salt and pepper.', 'Slice jalapeño into thin rounds, removing ribs and seeds for less heat. In a second small bowl, combine jalapeño, 1 TBSP hot water, ½ tsp sugar (1 tsp for 4 servings), juice from half the lime (whole lime for 4), and a pinch of salt.', 'In a third small bowl, combine guacamole, sour cream, and a squeeze of lime juice.', 'Pat diced steak dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over high heat. Once oil is shimmering, add steak and sprinkle with Southwest Spice. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, 2-3 minutes. (TIP: Lower heat if steak begins to brown too quickly.) Turn off heat. Season with salt and pepper.', 'Fluff rice with a fork; stir in remaining lime zest and season with salt. Divide between bowls. Top rice with diced steak, salsa, avocado crema, as much pickled jalapeño as you like, and Monterey Jack. Serve with any remaining lime wedges on the side.']
