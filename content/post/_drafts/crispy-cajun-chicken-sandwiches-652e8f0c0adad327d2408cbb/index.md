instructionTitles: ['Prep & Roast Potatoes', 'Make Sauce & Mix Coatings', 'Coat Chicken', 'Fry Chicken', 'Toast Buns', 'Finish & Serve']
instructions: ['• Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Mince a few pickle slices until you have 1 tsp (2 tsp for 4 servings). • Toss potatoes on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of oil, ½ TBSP Cajun Spice Blend (you’ll use more in the next step), salt, and pepper. • Roast on top rack until golden brown and tender, 20-25 minutes.', '• While potatoes roast, in a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, hot sauce, minced pickle, and ¼ tsp sugar (½ tsp for 4 servings). TIP: If you like things less spicy, add hot sauce to taste. • In a medium bowl, combine sour cream with 4 TBSP water (8 TBSP for 4); season with salt and pepper. • In a shallow dish, combine flour, cornstarch, 1 TBSP Cajun Spice Blend (2 TBSP for 4), 1 tsp salt (2 tsp for 4), and pepper. (You’ll use the rest of the Cajun Spice Blend in the next step.)', '• Pat chicken* dry with paper towels. Place between two large pieces of plastic wrap; pound with a mallet or heavy-bottomed pan until about 1⁄3 inch thick. Season all over with salt, pepper, and remaining Cajun Spice Blend. • Working one piece at a time, coat chicken in flour mixture, then dip into sour cream mixture until fully coated on both sides; press again into flour mixture. Shake off excess flour and set aside on a plate.', '• Heat a 1⁄3-inch layer of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Once oil is hot enough that a pinch of flour mixture sizzles immediately when added to the pan, add coated chicken. Cook until golden brown and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side. TIP: Fry in batches if necessary; lower heat if chicken begins to brown too quickly. • Transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. Season with salt.', '• While chicken cooks, halve and toast buns. • Spread cut sides of buns with 2 TBSP butter (4 TBSP for 4 servings).', '• Spread cut sides of buns with secret sauce. Fill buns with chicken and as much sliced pickle as you like. • Divide sandwiches between plates and serve with potato wedges on the side. TIP: If you have some on hand, serve with ketchup for dipping. Chicken is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 165º.']
