Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into ¼-inch-thick pieces (halve lengthwise first if carrots are on the larger side). • Toss zucchini and carrots on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, half the Za’atar Spice (all for 4 servings), salt, and pepper. (TIP: For easy cleanup, line sheet with aluminum foil first.) Roast on top rack until browned and tender, 18-22 minutes.', '• Meanwhile, in a small pot, combine couscous, stock concentrate, 1 cup water (2 cups for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until tender, 6-8 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.', '• Peel and mince or grate garlic; reserve a pinch in a small bowl. Zest and quarter lemon. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.', '• To bowl with reserved garlic, add sour cream and a pinch of lemon zest (big pinch for 4 servings). Add water 1 tsp at a time until sauce reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper.', '• Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites and a pinch of salt; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute. • Add turkey*, Turkish Spice Blend, half the soy sauce (all for 4 servings), and remaining garlic. Cook, breaking meat up into pieces, until turkey is cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. TIP: Near the end of cooking, stir in a splash of water and scrape up browned bits from bottom of pan to ensure turkey is saucy and flavorful!', '• Fluff couscous with a fork; stir in roasted veggies, a squeeze of lemon juice (two squeezes for 4 servings), and a drizzle of olive oil. Taste and season with salt and pepper. • Divide couscous between bowls; top with turkey. Drizzle with sauce and garnish with almonds and scallion greens. Serve with any remaining lemon wedges on the side. Ground Turkey is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 165°.']
