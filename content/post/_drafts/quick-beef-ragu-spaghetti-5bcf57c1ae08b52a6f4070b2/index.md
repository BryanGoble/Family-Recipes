title: 'Quick Beef Ragù Spaghetti'
description: "Spaghetti with tomato sauce is always a recipe for success. Is there anyone who’d turn down a plate of noodles piled high and dusted with cheese? Surely not, although adding some extra meat and veg certainly makes it all the more crave-worthy. And that’s exactly what we’re doing in this version: taking a tried-and-true Italian American classic and filling it out with hearty ground beef and bites of tender zucchini."
