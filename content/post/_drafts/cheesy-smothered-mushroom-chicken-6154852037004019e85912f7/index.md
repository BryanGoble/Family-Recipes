title: 'Cheesy Smothered Mushroom Chicken'
description: "Chicken and melted cheese is always a recipe for success. Chicken and melted cheese plus a rich gravy, however, is the ultimate comfort trifecta. And since we’ve been feeling the late-winter blues lately, we’re looking for an extra warm and cozy meal. Seared chicken is topped with a umami-packed mushroom gravy and melty Monterey Jack cheese. On the side, there’s sour cream mashed potatoes and crispy-edged roasted carrots for maximum deliciousness (and for catching any runoff sauce)."

Turn off heat; transfer to a plate.', 'Heat pot with potatoes over low heat; add 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) and half the sour cream. Using a potato masher or fork, mash potatoes, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as needed, until smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.', 'Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for chicken over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and scallion whites; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until softened, 2-4 minutes. Stir in stock concentrate and ¼ cup water (⅓ cup for 4 servings). Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until slightly thickened, 1-2 minutes.
