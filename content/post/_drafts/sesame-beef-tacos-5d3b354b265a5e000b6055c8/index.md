title: 'Sesame Beef Tacos'
description: "With Cinco de Mayo on the calendar this week, we wondered how to best celebrate the occasion. Tacos were a sure bet, but what to put in them? Instead of going the traditional route, we decided to mix things up with Korean-spiced sesame beef, pickled cucumber and radishes, and a chili crema. An unconventional choice, perhaps, but one that lives up to the maxim that everything tastes better in a tortilla."
