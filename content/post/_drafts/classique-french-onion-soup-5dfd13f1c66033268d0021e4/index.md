title: 'Classique French Onion Soup'
description: "The classics are classics for a reason. This dish happens to be extra special, though, and not just because it’s classique. French onion soup is a bistro staple—one of those ultra-comforting dishes you always order but never think to make at home. Well, it’s time to cancel that reservation at Chez Fromage because you’re about to master it from the comfort of your own kitchen! Our elevated take’s got deeply caramelized onions spiked with balsamic and fresh thyme, a rich mushroom stock, and melty gruyere toasts. There’s also a bright Dijon apple side salad to round things out. Bon appétit, mon chéris!"
