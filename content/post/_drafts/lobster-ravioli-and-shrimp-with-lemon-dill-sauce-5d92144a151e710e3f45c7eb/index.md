title: 'Lemon Dill Lobster Ravioli and Shrimp'
description: "This is not your typical ravioli. To take the tender pasta pillows to the next level, we filled them with succulent lobster meat, paired them with sweet sautéed shrimp, and tossed them in a lemony dill cream sauce. For an elevated finish (and delicious crunch), we tangled marinated zucchini ribbons on top."
