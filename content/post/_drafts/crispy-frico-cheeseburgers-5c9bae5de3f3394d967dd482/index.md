title: 'Crispy Cheddar Frico Cheeseburgers'
description: "We’ve taken cheeseburgers to the next level with the help of a little something called frico (aka cheese crisps). They look fancy-schmancy, but making them simply involves baking cheddar cheese until it reaches crispy, golden-brown perfection. On top of burgers with onion jam, tomatoes, and ketchup, they feel like a crowning achievement in topping technology."
