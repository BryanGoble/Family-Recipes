title: 'Kale, Apple & Feta Harvest Salad'
description: "Step aside, side salad—this hearty kale bowl is the stuff of lunch dreams. You’ll combine tenderized greens with pan-fried chickpeas and shallot, juicy apple slices, and briny feta, then toss it all with a tangy Dijon vinaigrette. Sprinkle your salad with chewy-sweet dried cranberries just before serving for a tangy finish that makes the whole dish pop."

ingredients: ['1 unit Shallot', '1 unit Chickpeas', '1 unit Apple', '1 teaspoon Garlic Powder', '4 ounce Kale', '5 teaspoon Balsamic Vinegar', '2 teaspoon Dijon Mustard', '2 ounce Mixed Greens', '½ cup Feta Cheese', '1 ounce Dried Cranberries', '11 teaspoon Olive Oil', '1 teaspoon Cooking Oil', ' Salt', ' Pepper']

instructionTitles: []
instructions: ['• Wash and dry produce.', '• Halve, peel, and thinly slice shallot. Drain and rinse chickpeas; dry thoroughly with paper towels. Halve, core, and dice apple into ½-inch pieces.', '• Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add shallot and chickpeas; season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until chickpeas are warmed through and browned in spots, 2-4 minutes. (TIP: It’s natural for chickpeas to pop a bit; lower heat if needed.) Transfer to a plate to cool.', '• Meanwhile, remove and discard any large stems from kale; chop into bite- size pieces.', '• Place kale in a large bowl. Using your hands, massage (similar to how you would knead dough) with a large drizzle of olive oil until leaves are tender, 1-2 minutes. TIP: Don’t skip this step—massaging helps the kale leaves wilt slightly, lending a tender (never fibrous!) texture.', '• In a small bowl, whisk together vinegar, Dijon, 3 TBSP olive oil, and ¼ tsp sugar (6 TBSP olive oil and ½ tsp sugar for 4 servings).', '• Add mixed greens, shallot and chickpeas, apple, and feta to bowl with kale. Drizzle with as much dressing as you like; toss to combine.', '• Divide salad between bowls and garnish with dried cranberries. Serve. TIP: Taking it to go? Refrigerate prepared ingredients in separate containers, then toss when ready to eat.']
