title: 'Winner Winner Chicken Orzo Dinner'
description: "Although this recipe’s zucchini and tomato medley is a side, it takes center stage in our eyes. It’s equally as creamy as it is crispy, and the combination of panko, mozzarella, and Parmesan sprinkled on top is to thank for that. Served next to an herbed chicken breast and lemony orzo that keep things simple and satisfying, this meal keeps it light without lacking in flavor."
