instructionTitles: ['Prep', 'Make Crust', 'Coat Chicken', 'Roast Chicken and Potatoes', 'Steam Broccoli', 'Serve']
instructions: ['Adjust racks to middle and top positions and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Dice potatoes into ½-inch pieces. Toss on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil, half the BBQ Seasoning, pepper, and a large pinch of salt. Set aside.', 'Place 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in a medium microwave-safe bowl; microwave until melted, 30-45 seconds. Stir in a large drizzle of olive oil, remaining BBQ Seasoning, pepper, and a large pinch of salt. Add panko and stir until evenly combined.', 'Pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Lightly oil a second baking sheet and place chicken on it. Evenly spread sour cream onto tops of chicken breasts, then mound with panko mixture, pressing to adhere (no need to coat the undersides).', 'Place sheet with chicken on middle rack and sheet with potatoes on top rack. Roast, tossing potatoes halfway through, until chicken is cooked through and potatoes are crispy, 20-25 minutes. TIP: If potatoes finish first, remove from oven and continue roasting chicken.', 'Meanwhile, cut any large broccoli florets into bite-size pieces. Place in a large microwave-safe bowl with 1 tsp water. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and poke a few holes in wrap. Microwave until broccoli is tender, 1-2 minutes. Carefully remove plastic wrap (watch out for steam). Drain any water left in bowl, then toss broccoli with 1 TBSP butter until melted. Season with salt and pepper.', 'Divide chicken, potatoes, and broccoli between plates. Drizzle chicken with as much hot honey as you like.']
