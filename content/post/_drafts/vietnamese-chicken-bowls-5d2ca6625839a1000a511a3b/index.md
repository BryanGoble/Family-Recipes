title: 'Vietnamese Chicken Bowls'
description: "We love Vietnamese cuisine because it embraces flavors that are big, bright, and dazzling without feeling heavy. This recipe is a great example because it combines chicken, rice, and crisp veggies in a way that is incredibly well-balanced. The meat is drizzled in a savory-spicy sauce with soy, lime, and sriracha. Next to it, there’s fluffy jasmine rice and a zesty carrot and cucumber salad with cilantro. When piled together in a bowl, it’s simple, satisfying dinner perfection."
