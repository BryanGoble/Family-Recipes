title: 'Sirloin Steak & Roasted Garlic Pan Sauce'
description: "Serious about steak? So are our chefs! That’s why they took sirloin to the next level by topping it with a luxurious pan sauce. Here, roasted garlic and rich beef demi-glace mingle with the fond (aka the crispy bits and drippings left in the pan after cooking the meat) to create a condiment you’ll want to drizzle over just about everything… especially the chive-flecked mashed potatoes and roasted broccoli on the side."
