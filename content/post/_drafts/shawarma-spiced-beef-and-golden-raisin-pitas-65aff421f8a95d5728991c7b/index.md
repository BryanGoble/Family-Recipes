title: 'Shawarma-Spiced Beef & Golden Raisin Pitas'
description: "Pita pockets: making portable food possible since...the beginning of recorded culinary history?! Our chefs ditched the ole cave fire for a stove and swapped the spit-roasted game for savory shawarma-spiced beef sautéed with plump golden raisins. It’s all tucked into a fluffy, warm pita pocket layered with quick-pickled red onion and a tangy lemon cream sauce. With a side of crunchy blue corn chips for swiping up any tasty loose ends, you’re good to go (or stay)—no hunting and gathering required!"

ingredients: ['1 unit Red Onion', '1 unit Lemon', '10 ounce Ground Beef', '1 unit Ketchup', '1 ounce Golden Raisins', '1 tablespoon Shawarma Spice Blend', '2 tablespoon Mayonnaise', '1.5 tablespoon Sour Cream', '2 unit Whole Wheat Pitas', '1 teaspoon Hot Sauce', '1.5 ounce Blue Corn Tortilla Chips', ' Salt', ' Pepper', '1 teaspoon Cooking Oil']

instructionTitles: ['Prep & Pickle Onion', 'Cook Beef', 'Warm Pitas & Make Sauce', 'Serve']
instructions: ['• Wash and dry produce. • Halve, peel, and thinly slice half the onion (whole onion for 4 servings). Quarter lemon. • In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine sliced onion, juice from half the lemon, and a pinch of salt. Cover with plastic wrap; microwave until softened, 30-40 seconds. Uncover and stir, then set aside to pickle.', '• Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Add beef*, ketchup, raisins, Shawarma Spice Blend, a big pinch of salt, and pepper. • Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until cooked through, 4-6 minutes.', '• Meanwhile, wrap pitas in damp paper towels; microwave until warm and pliable, 30-40 seconds. Halve pitas; gently pull apart to create pockets. TIP: Halve pitas one at a time to make opening easier and prevent sticking. • In a second small bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream, and juice from one lemon wedge (two wedges for 4 servings). Taste and season with salt and pepper.', '• Fill pita halves with beef. Top with white sauce, pickled onion (draining first), and as much hot sauce as you like. • Divide pitas between plates. Serve with tortilla chips and any remaining lemon wedges on the side. Ground Beef is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160°.']
