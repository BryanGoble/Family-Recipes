title: 'Crab Cakes Under a Meyer Lemon-Dressed Salad'
description: "Crab is one of the gems of the sea: it’s tender and sweet in ways that other shellfish can only aspire to. So when our chefs devised this recipe with ready-to-cook crab cakes, we knew it would be impossible to resist. The cakes have just enough breading and veggies to give them the perfect amount of moistness, tenderness, and crunch. To let them really shine, we’re keeping the sides simple: a salad with Meyer lemon dressing and potatoes roasted with smoked paprika."
