title: 'Cajun-Spiced Crispy Tilapia Sandwiches'
description: "A fried fish sandwich made right in your kitchen in 30 minutes or less? Sign. Us. Up. For this winning rendition on a sumptuously savory sammie, mild, flaky tilapia fillets are dipped in Cajun-spiced tempura batter, then fried until golden and light-as-air crispy. They’re tucked cozily into toasted baguettes along with a swipe of tangy lime-spiked mayo and a tangle of crunchy cabbage slaw. On the side are golden Cajun-spiced potato wedges—the perfect match."

ingredients: ['12 ounce Potatoes', '1 unit Lime', '1 tablespoon Cajun Spice Blend', '4 ounce Coleslaw Mix', '6 tablespoon Mayonnaise', '11 ounce Tilapia', '82 g Tempura Mix', '2 unit Demi-Baguette', ' Salt', ' Pepper', '2 teaspoon Cooking Oil', '1 teaspoon Sugar']

instructionTitles: ['Prep', 'Season & Roast Potatoes', 'Make Slaw & Lime Mayo', 'Mix Batter & Coat Fish', 'Fry Fish', 'Toast Baguettes', 'Finish & Serve']
instructions: ['• Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Cut potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Zest and halve lime.', '• Toss potatoes on a baking sheet with half the Cajun Spice Blend, a large drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. • Roast on top rack until browned and tender, 20-25 minutes.', '• In a medium bowl, combine coleslaw mix, juice from half the lime, 1 tsp sugar (2 tsp for 4 servings), salt, and pepper. • In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise and as much lime zest as you like. • Refrigerate slaw and lime mayo until ready to use.', '• In a large bowl, whisk together tempura batter mix, remaining Cajun Spice Blend, ½ cup cold water (⅔ cup for 4 servings), and ½ tsp salt (1 tsp for 4) until smooth. TIP: If mixture is too thick, add more cold water 1 TBSP at a time until it reaches a pancake-batter-like consistency. • Pat tilapia* dry with paper towels. Season all over with salt and pepper. Add tilapia to bowl with batter; gently toss until evenly coated.', '• Heat a ¼-inch layer of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Once oil is hot enough that a drop of batter sizzles when added to the pan, add tilapia in a single layer. (Shake off excess batter before adding.) • Cook until golden brown and cooked through, 2-3 minutes per side. TIP: To check for doneness, cut one filet in half. (For 4 servings, fry fish in batches, adding more oil as needed and allowing oil to get hot in between batches.) • Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. Immediately season with salt and pepper.', '• While tilapia cooks, halve baguettes lengthwise and toast until golden.', '• Spread cut sides of baguette halves with as much lime mayo as you like; fill with tilapia and slaw. • Divide sandwiches between plates; serve with potato wedges and any remaining lime mayo on the side for dipping. Tilapia is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 145°.']
