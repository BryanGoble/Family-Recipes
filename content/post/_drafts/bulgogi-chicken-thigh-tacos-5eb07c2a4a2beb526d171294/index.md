title: 'Bulgogi Chicken Tacos'
description: "Korean and Mexican flavors may seem like they’re at opposite ends of the culinary spectrum. But when they meet in the middle, the results are absolutely delicious. These mashup tacos feature chicken in bulgogi sauce—a Korean-style marinade of soy sauce and sesame with a little bit of sweetness. When you tuck that into tortillas with cabbage, pickled cucumber, and a spicy crema, it feels like a border-hopping celebration in your mouth."
