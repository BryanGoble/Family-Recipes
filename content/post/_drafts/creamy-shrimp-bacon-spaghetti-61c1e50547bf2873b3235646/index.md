title: 'Creamy Shrimp & Bacon Spaghetti'
description: "No matter the season, a summer-style pasta is one of those meals that always satisfies. This one has not just one but TWO proteins: succulent shrimp and crispy bacon. Add to that charred corn, salty Parmesan, a creamy cheese roux, and fresh lemon juice, then twirl it all into spaghetti—that’s one dish that will make you feel like you’re basking under the summer sun (whether you are or not!)."

instructions: ['• Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. • Drain and rinse corn; pat dry with paper towels. Peel and mince garlic. Mince chives. Quarter lemon. • Once water is boiling, add spaghetti to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. • Reserve 1½ cups pasta cooking water (2 cups for 4 servings), then drain.', '• While pasta cooks, heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Add corn and paprika; cook, stirring occasionally, until corn is lightly charred, 4-6 minutes. (TIP: If corn begins to pop, cover pan.) Season with ¼ tsp sugar (½ tsp for 4 servings), salt, and pepper. • Turn off heat; transfer corn to a large bowl. Wipe out pan.', '• Heat same pan over medium-high heat. Add bacon* and cook, turning occasionally, until crispy, 6-10 minutes. TIP: Lower heat if bacon begins to brown too quickly. • Turn off heat; transfer bacon to a paper\x02towel-lined plate. • Carefully discard all but a thin layer of bacon fat (you’ll use this to cook shrimp).', '• Meanwhile, rinse shrimp* under cold water; pat dry with paper towels. Season all over with salt and pepper. • Heat pan with bacon fat over high heat. Once pan is very hot, add shrimp. Cook, stirring occasionally, until opaque and cooked through, 2-3 minutes. • Using a slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to a paper-towel-lined plate. Remove pan from heat; let cool for 1 minute.', '• Return same pan to medium-high heat. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. • Whisk in 1 cup reserved pasta cooking water (1½ cups for 4 servings), cheese roux, and stock concentrate. Cook, whisking, until slightly thickened, 2-3 minutes. • Reduce heat to medium low and whisk in cream cheese until thoroughly combined.', '• Add drained spaghetti, half the Parmesan (save the rest for serving), and 2 TBSP butter (4 TBSP for 4 servings) to pan with sauce. Cook, tossing, until butter has melted and pasta is coated in a creamy sauce, 1-2 minutes. (TIP: If needed, stir in more pasta cooking water a splash at a time.) Taste and season with salt and pepper.', '• Roughly chop bacon. • Stir shrimp, half the bacon, half the corn, half the chives, and half the lemon juice into pan with pasta. • Divide pasta between plates. Top with remaining bacon, remaining corn, remaining Parmesan, remaining chives, and chili flakes to taste. Squeeze juice from remaining lemon over top to taste and serve.']
