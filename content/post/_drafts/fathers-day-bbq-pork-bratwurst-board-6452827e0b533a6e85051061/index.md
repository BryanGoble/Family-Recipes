description: "Summer entertaining is all about the BBQ (and the sausages!) and who loves BBQ more than the father in your life? For Father’s Day, we kicked these classics up a notch with mix ’n’ match options galore. You’ll serve pulled pork in a vinegary BBQ sauce with creamy Cajun-spiced mac ’n’ cheese, juicy grilled brats, a homemade creamy Dijon slaw, and tangy dill pickles, plus brioche buns to make your perfect sando—or not! Feel free to enjoy it right off the board, family-style, so Dad can build his dream plate!"

ingredients: ['12 ounce Cavatappi Pasta', '8 tablespoon Mayonnaise', '10 teaspoon Red Wine Vinegar', '4 teaspoon Dijon Mustard', '8 ounce Shredded Red Cabbage', '2 tablespoon Cajun Spice Blend', '18 ounce Bratwurst', '16 ounce Pulled Pork', '1.5 cup BBQ Sauce', '8 ounce Cream Sauce Base', '2 cup White Cheddar Cheese', '4 unit Brioche Buns', '2 unit Sliced Dill Pickle', '1 teaspoon Cooking Oil', '¾ teaspoon Sugar', ' Salt', ' Pepper']

instructionTitles: []
instructions: ['Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once boiling, add cavatappi to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water, then drain and set aside. (Keep pot handy for Step 5!)', 'Wash and dry produce. While pasta cooks, in a medium bowl, whisk together half the mayonnaise, half the vinegar, half the mustard, and 1½ tsp sugar. Add cabbage season with salt and pepper; toss until evenly coated.', 'In a small bowl, whisk together remaining mayonnaise, remaining mustard, and 1 tsp Cajun Spice Blend. Rinse whisk.', 'Heat a drizzle of oil in a medium pan over medium heat. Add sausage* and sear until browned all over, 6-8 minutes. (You may need to cook in batches. If sausage begins to brown too quickly, reduce heat to medium low.) Reduce heat to low and cover pan with lid; cook until cooked through, 5-7 minutes more. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve. GRILLING ALTERNATIVE: Add sausage to grill or grill pan. Grill until browned and cooked through, 10-12 minutes per side. (If sausage begins to brown too quickly, reduce heat to medium low.)', 'Meanwhile, tear (or chop) pulled pork* into smaller pieces. Heat a large pan over medium heat. Add pork and cook until pork begins to brown, 2-3 minutes. Stir in BBQ sauce, remaining vinegar, and ¼ cup water; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until pork is warmed through and sauce has thickened slightly, 2-3 minutes more. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.', 'While sausage and pork cook, return pot used for pasta to medium-low heat. Add cream sauce base and remaining Cajun Spice Blend; bring to a simmer and cook, whisking, until slightly thickened, 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and whisk in cheddar cheese until melted and smooth. Stir in drained cavatappi, adding reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until pasta is coated in a creamy sauce (we used ⅓ cup). Taste and season with salt and pepper.', 'Halve and toast buns. Cut sausage into 1-inch-thick slices. Transfer BBQ pork, mac ’n’ cheese, slaw, pickles, and Cajun mayo to individual serving bowls and place on a large board or platter. Fill remaining gaps on board with buns and sausage slices. Serve family style. Bratwurst Sausage is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160°. Pulled Pork is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160°.']
