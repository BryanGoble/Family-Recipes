title: 'Lemon Cream Chicken Cutlets'
description: "If we were forced to choose a favorite food group, we just might pick sauce—we firmly believe it’s one of the best parts of any dish. That’s why we’re over the moon for this silky garlic-lemon version: It’s rich, creamy, tangy, and couldn’t be simpler to make. Just sauté garlic until fragrant, then stir in chicken stock, sour cream, and lemon juice for positively luscious results. It’s spooned all over chicken cutlets seasoned with warm, aromatic Shawarma spices. Pro tip: You’ll want to save a bit for dipping your sides of roasted green beans and dill potatoes, ‘cause there’s nothing this sauce can’t do."
