ingredients: ['¼ ounce Chives', '¼ cup Panko Breadcrumbs', '1 teaspoon Garlic Powder', '12 ounce Chicken Breasts', '2 tablespoon Sour Cream', '6 ounce Spaghetti', '4 ounce Bacon', '5 ounce Spinach', '1 ounce Cheese Roux Concentrate', '2 tablespoon Cream Cheese', '¼ cup Parmesan Cheese', '1 tablespoon Cooking Oil', '3 tablespoon Butter', ' Salt', ' Pepper']

instructionTitles: ['Prep & Mix Panko', 'Bake Chicken', 'Cook Pasta', 'Cook Bacon & Spinach', 'Make Sauce', 'Toss Pasta', 'Serve']
instructions: ['• Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Lightly oil a baking sheet. Wash and dry produce. • Mince chives. • Place 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in a small microwave- safe bowl. Microwave until melted, 30 seconds. Stir in panko, half the garlic powder (you’ll use the rest later), and a large drizzle of oil. Season with salt and pepper.', '• Pat chicken* dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Place on prepared baking sheet. Evenly spread a thin layer of sour cream onto tops of chicken (you may have some left over). Mound coated sides with panko mixture, pressing to adhere (no need to coat the undersides). • Roast on middle rack until crust is golden brown and chicken is cooked through, 18-22 minutes.', '• Once water is boiling, add spaghetti to pot. Cook until al dente, 9-11 minutes. • Reserve 1½ cups pasta cooking water (2 cups for 4 servings), then drain. Keep empty pot handy for step 5.', '• Meanwhile, heat a large, dry pan over medium-high heat. Add bacon* and cook, turning occasionally and adjusting heat if browning too quickly, until crispy, 6-10 minutes. • Transfer bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate. Once cool enough to handle, chop into small pieces. • Let pan with bacon fat cool slightly, then carefully add spinach. (TIP: Allowing the pan to cool will help prevent splattering.) Cook over medium heat, stirring, until wilted, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat.', '• Once pasta and bacon are done, return empty pot used for pasta to medium heat. Add cheese roux, remaining garlic powder, and 1 cup reserved pasta cooking water (1½ cups for 4 servings); whisk to combine. Cook, whisking, until slightly thickened, 2-3 minutes. • Lower heat to medium low and whisk in cream cheese until smooth.', '• Add drained spaghetti, Parmesan, half the chives, and 2 TBSP butter (3 TBSP for 4 servings) to pot with alfredo sauce. Cook, stirring, until butter has melted and pasta is coated in a creamy sauce. • Stir in bacon and spinach. (TIP: If needed, stir in more reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time.) Season with salt and pepper to taste.', '• Divide pasta between plates. Top with crispy chicken. Garnish with remaining chives and serve.']
