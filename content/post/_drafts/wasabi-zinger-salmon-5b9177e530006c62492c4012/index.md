title: 'Wasabi Zinger Salmon'
description: "Wasabi may be better known as the green spicy stuff that comes with sushi, but it can be used in so many more ways. In this recipe, the horseradish paste is blended into a mixture of lime and sour cream, creating a sauce for salmon that’s equal parts tangy, zesty, and exhilarating. The fish is served with sesame green beans and scallion rice on the side, resulting in a meal that combines Asian-style flavors with classic and simple techniques."

ingredients: ['1 unit Veggie Stock Concentrate', '½ cup Jasmine Rice', '2 unit Scallions', '1 unit Lime', '4 tablespoon Sour Cream', '1 teaspoon Wasabi Paste', '10 ounce Salmon', '6 ounce Green Beans', '1 tablespoon Sesame Seeds', '1 tablespoon Vegetable Oil', '1 tablespoon Butter', ' Salt', ' Pepper']

instructionTitles: ['Cook Rice', 'Prep', 'Make Wasabi Cream', 'Cook Salmon', 'Cook Green Beans', 'Finish and Serve']
instructions: ['In a small pot, combine ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4 servings) and stock concentrate. Bring to a boil, then add rice. Cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.', 'While rice cooks, wash and dry all produce (except green beans). Zest lime and cut into wedges. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.', 'In a small bowl, combine sour cream, a squeeze of lime juice, and as much lime zest and wasabi as you like (start with a pinch of wasabi and add more from there if desired). Season with salt and pepper. TIP: Give the mixture a taste and adjust with more lime zest, lime juice, or wasabi if you feel like something is missing.', 'Pat salmon dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add salmon skin sides down. Cook until skin is crisp and fish is almost cooked through, 5-7 minutes. Flip and cook to desired doneness, 1-2 minutes more. Remove from pan and set aside.', 'Meanwhile, pierce green bean bag with a fork; place bag on a plate. Microwave until tender, 1-2 minutes. (TIP: No microwave? No problem! Steam beans in a small pot with a splash of water until just tender, 5-7 minutes.) Carefully transfer green beans to a large bowl; toss with a drizzle of oil, sesame seeds, salt, and pepper.', 'Fluff rice with a fork; stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) and scallion whites. Season with salt and pepper. Divide rice and green beans between plates. Arrange salmon on top of rice, then dollop with wasabi cream. Sprinkle with scallion greens. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.']
