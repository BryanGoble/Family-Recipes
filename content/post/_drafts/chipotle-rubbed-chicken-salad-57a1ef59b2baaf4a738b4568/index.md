title: 'Chipotle-Rubbed Chicken Salad'
description: "This, my friends, is the burrito bowl of all burrito bowls. It contains the unbeatable flavor combo of chipotle and tangy lime zest, but what takes it up a notch is the oregano-scented black beans, homemade pico de gallo, and summery citronette dressing. This isn’t your ordinary dinner. It’s a fiesta!"
