description: "We’re helping you get one big step closer to slow-cooked perfection with our ready-to-heat pulled chicken. We’ve already taken care of making the meat pull-apart tender; you’ve just got to warm it up with some spices for extra flavor. You’ll be serving it on top of fluffy jasmine rice with some fresh tomato salsa and sour cream to keep things cool."
