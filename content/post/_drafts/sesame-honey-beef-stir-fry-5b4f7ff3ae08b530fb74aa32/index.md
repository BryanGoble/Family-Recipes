title: 'Sesame Honey Beef Stir-Fry'
description: "If you’ve ever struggled with getting your kids to eat their carrots, we think we’ve discovered a pretty nifty workaround. Here, they’re shaved into ribbons that are fun to twirl around a fork. And because they’re paper thin, there are no big chunks or hunks for picky eaters to object to. It helps, too, that they’re coated in a sesame, honey, and soy–based sauce, which adds on irresistible sweet and savory flavors."

ingredients: ['2 unit Carrots', '4 clove Garlic', '4 unit Scallions', '1 unit Lime', '1 cup Jasmine Rice', '4 teaspoon Sriracha', '2 tablespoon Sesame Oil', '6 tablespoon Soy Sauce', '2 ounce Honey', '20 ounce Ground Beef', '1 tablespoon Sesame Seeds', '2 teaspoon Vegetable Oil', ' Salt', ' Pepper']

instructionTitles: ['Prep', 'Cook Rice', 'Cook Carrots', 'Cook Beef', 'Finish Stir-Fry', 'Serve']
instructions: ['Wash and dry all produce. Bring 1⅔ cups water and a large pinch of salt to a boil in a small pot. Peel carrots. Using a vegetable peeler, shave carrots lengthwise into thin ribbons. Mince garlic. Trim, then thinly slice scallions, keeping greens and whites separate. Halve lime; cut one half into four wedges.', 'Once water is boiling, add rice to pot. Cover, lower heat, and reduce to a gentle simmer. Cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Keep covered off heat until meal is ready. Meanwhile, combine sriracha (to taste), 1 TBSP sesame oil, 2 TBSP soy sauce, and 2 TBSP honey in a small bowl (we’ll use the rest of the sesame oil, soy sauce, and honey later).', 'Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add carrots and cook, tossing, until tender and lightly browned, 4-5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from pan and set aside.', 'Heat another drizzle of oil in pan used for carrots over medium-high heat. Add garlic and scallion whites. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add beef, breaking up meat into pieces. Cook until no longer pink, about 4 minutes. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring only once or twice, until brown and crispy in spots, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.', 'Add carrots to pan with beef, along with remaining soy sauce and honey. Toss to combine. Remove pan from heat and stir in remaining sesame oil. Add a squeeze or two of lime (to taste). Season with salt and pepper, if needed (it may already be salty enough).', 'Divide rice and stir-fry between bowls. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and scallion greens. Drizzle with sriracha mixture. (TIP: You may want to skip this for the kids, especially if they’re not fans of spice.) Serve with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over.']
