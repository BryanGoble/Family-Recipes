title: 'Pork al Mojo'
description: "Mojo is the Cuban version of sunshine on a plate: the sauce beams flavor with its vibrant citrus juices, fresh herbs, and savory bits of garlic. When it’s drizzled onto tender pork chops, the effect is truly radiant. To add on the warm vibes, we’re also introducing lively bell pepper slices and zesty beans with rice. If the weather’s been a bit nippy where you are, this dish will likely hit the spot and brighten up your day."
