title: 'Steak with Mushroom Cream Sauce'
description: "Our ranch steak is so rich and gloriously meaty flavored that it could be a stand-alone dish. Still, we’re adding top-notch sides and a full-bodied sauce to this recipe so that it soars above and beyond. Crispy roasted potatoes and tender roasted carrots make it filling and hearty, while the creamy mushroom pan sauce spooned on top has savory complexity. Are you drooling yet? We’re pretty confident this steak dinner will more than meat your expectations."
