title: 'French Onion Bavette Steak'
description: "Beef up your French onion soup love with this flavorful bavette steak that’s called the “butcher’s cut” because it’s such a tasty one! The steak is seared, then topped with a savory-sweet French onion soup-inspired pan sauce flavored with herbaceous thyme and finished with swirls of sour cream and butter. Meanwhile a bell pepper-studded hash of sweet and white potatoes roasts to caramelized perfection in the oven, along with simple salt and pepper asparagus sprinkled with crisp, nutty toasted almonds.Truly, a meal fit for a king."

Let cool slightly, then wash out pan.', '• Roast seasoned asparagus on middle rack until tender and lightly browned, 10-12 minutes. • In the last 1-2 minutes of roasting, remove baking sheet from oven; carefully sprinkle almonds over asparagus.

Add remaining Vidalia onion paste; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 10-20 seconds. • Add stock concentrate, 1⁄3 cup water, and a pinch of thyme (½ cup water and a large pinch of thyme for 4 servings); bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened slightly, 3-4 minutes. • Remove from heat and stir in sour cream and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4) until melted and combined.', '• Thinly slice steak against the grain. • Divide steak, mixed potato hash, and asparagus between plates.
