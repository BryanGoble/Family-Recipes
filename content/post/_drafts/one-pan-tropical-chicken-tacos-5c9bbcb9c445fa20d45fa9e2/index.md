title: 'One-Pan Tropical Chicken Tacos'
description: "It’s not always easy to eat enough fruit. Luckily, these tacos feature plenty of it—plus some bonus veggies, too—thanks to a pineapple and lime salsa (with a bit of onion and cilantro tossed in) that’s probably the easiest way to get picky eaters to eat their produce. The salsa joins warmly spiced chicken and a hot-sauce crema inside warm tortillas. Oh, and bonus alert: it can all be made with just one pan, so cleanup will be a breeze."
