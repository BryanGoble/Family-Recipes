ingredients: ['9 ounce Carrots', '2 unit Scallions', '1 tablespoon Fajita Spice Blend', '1 teaspoon Turmeric', '½ cup White Rice', '10 ounce Skin-on Salmon', ' Salt', ' Pepper', '1 tablespoon Cooking Oil', '1 tablespoon Butter', '8 ounce Broccoli', '1.5 tablespoon Sour Cream']

instructionTitles: ['Prep & Roast Carrots', 'Cook Rice', 'Cook Salmon', 'Finish & Serve']
instructions: ['• Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into ½-inch-thick pieces. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. • Toss carrots on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of oil, half the Fajita Spice Blend, salt, and pepper. Roast on top rack until browned and tender, 20-25 minutes. Cut broccoli into bite-size pieces if necessary. (Reserve carrots for another use.) Swap in broccoli for carrots; roast for 15-20 minutes.', '• Meanwhile, in a small pot, melt 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) over medium-high heat. • Add scallion whites and half the turmeric (all for 4); cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 30-60 seconds. Add rice, ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4), and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.', '• Meanwhile, pat salmon* dry with paper towels; season all over with remaining Fajita Spice Blend, salt, and pepper. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Add salmon to pan, skin sides down. Cook until skin is crisp and fish is almost cooked through, 5-7 minutes. • Flip and cook until fish is opaque and cooked through, 1-2 minutes more. Turn off heat; transfer to a plate. Wipe out pan.', '• While salmon cooks, in a small bowl, combine sour cream and scallion greens. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper. • Fluff rice with a fork; taste and season with salt and pepper. Divide rice, salmon, and carrots between plates. Drizzle salmon with scallion crema and serve. Salmon is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 145°.']
