title: 'Cheesy Stuffed Mexican Meatloaves'
description: "When we say cheesy, we’re serious. These mini loaves are not only stuffed with our blend of Mexican cheeses, but have MORE gooey cheese melted on top. (Step aside, cheeseburger). Ground pork makes the meatloaves extra-juicy, which is the perfect textural contrast to all the aforementioned cheesiness. If that doesn’t grab you yet, how about piling poblano peppers, fresh tomato salsa, and lime crema on the meatloaves? Bye bye, boring!"

instructions: ['Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Trim scallions; thinly slice greens and mince whites. Thinly slice poblanos. Thinly slice jalapeño, removing seeds and ribs for less heat. Zest 1 tsp zest from limes; quarter limes. In a small bowl, combine jalapeño, 1 tsp sugar, salt, and the juice from 1 lime wedge.', 'Place rice, 1¾ cup water, and a large pinch of salt in a medium, lidded pot. Bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Turn off heat and keep covered until ready to serve.', 'In a medium bowl, combine pork, scallion whites, panko, Southwest Spice, and 2 tsp salt. Quarter mixture; flatten into ½-inch-thick rounds. Set aside half the cheese for topping. Divide remaining cheese between each round. Fold edges of meat around cheese, sealing to create four 1-inch-tall loaves.', 'Place meatloaves on one side of a lightly oiled baking sheet. Toss poblanos on other side of sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Bake until meatloaves are just cooked through and poblanos are lightly browned and tender, 15-20 minutes. Remove baking sheet from oven and top meatloaves with remaining cheese. Return to oven and bake until cheese has melted, about 2 minutes longer.', 'Meanwhile, finely dice tomatoes. Combine tomatoes, half the scallion greens, half the lime zest, and a squeeze of lime juice in a small bowl. Season generously with salt and pepper. In a separate small bowl, combine sour cream, a squeeze of lime juice, remaining lime zest, and a pinch of salt.', 'Fluff rice and 1 TBSP butter with a fork and season with salt and pepper. Divide rice between plates. Top with meatloaves, poblanos, salsa, and a dollop of lime crema. Garnish with pickled jalapeño (draining before adding) and remaining scallion greens. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.']
