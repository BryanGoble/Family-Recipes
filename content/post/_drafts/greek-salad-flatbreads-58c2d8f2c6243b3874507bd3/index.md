title: 'Greek Salad Flatbreads'
description: "Ah, the Greek salad. It’s one of those things that we don’t hesitate to order whenever we see it on a diner menu. The combo of lettuce, olives, feta, and veggies is a classic that can’t go wrong. With this recipe, though, we wanted to take the salad from reliable to radical, tossing its core ingredients on a flatbread and baking in the oven until warm, toasty, and bubbling with melted cheese."
