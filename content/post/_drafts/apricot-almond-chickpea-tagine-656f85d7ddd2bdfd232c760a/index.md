title: 'Chicken, Apricot & Chickpea Tagine'
description: "Tagine is named for the conical clay vessel it’s traditionally cooked in, but you don’t need one to make this dish! Here, our riff on the dish celebrates hearty veggies, fragrant spices, sweet apricots, and crunchy almonds (and swaps the usual couscous for fluffy basmati rice). On top, there’s two flavorful sauces: lemon cream and chermoula. The chermoula is chock-full of cilantro, garlic, olive oil, lemon, and jalapeño, which adds the perfect punch. The best part? All you need is 30 minutes for this awesome dish to land on your table."
