title: 'Cheesy Cajun-Spiced Pulled Pork Sandos'
description: "Peter Piper’s got nothing on this cheesy, smoky sando with bright pops of pickled pepper! Succulent pulled pork is warmed in a pan with bold Cajun spices, then topped with mozzarella. You’ll pile the saucy pork onto a ciabatta bun slathered with lime-infused Cajun-spiced mayonnaise, and top it with those quick-pickled mildly spicy green peppers for a bright, crunchy contrast. It’s the sandwich of our dreams come to life, though you’ll have to pinch yourself to be sure the 15-minute cooking time is real!"
