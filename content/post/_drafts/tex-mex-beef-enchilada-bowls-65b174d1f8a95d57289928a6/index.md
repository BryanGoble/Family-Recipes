instructionTitles: ['Prep', 'Cook Rice', 'Make Salsa & Crema', 'Cook Veggies', 'Cook Pork', 'Finish & Serve']
instructions: ['• Wash and dry produce. • Dice tomato. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion; mince a few slices until you have 2 TBSP (3 TBSP for 4 servings). Zest and quarter lime. Halve, core, and thinly slice green pepper into strips.', '• In a small pot, combine rice, ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.', '•While rice cooks, in a small bowl, combine tomato, minced onion, and juice from half the lime. Season with salt and pepper. • In a separate small bowl, combine crema and ¼ tsp Southwest Spice Blend (½ tsp for 4 servings). (You’ll use more Southwest Spice Blend in the next step.) Season with salt and pepper.', '• Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add green pepper and cook until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. • Add sliced onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until veggies are browned and tender, 5-7 minutes. • Add 2 TBSP water (4 TBSP for 4 servings), half the remaining Southwest Spice Blend (you’ll use the rest in the next step), salt, and pepper. Cook until water has mostly evaporated and veggies are coated, 1-2 minutes. • Turn off heat. Transfer to a plate; cover to keep warm. Wipe out pan.', '• Heat another drizzle of oil in pan used for veggies over medium-high heat. Add pork* and cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. TIP: If there’s excess grease in your pan, carefully pour it out. • Stir in Tex-Mex paste and remaining Southwest Spice Blend until combined. Add ¼ cup water (1⁄3 cup for 4 servings); simmer until mixture is reduced and saucy, 2-3 minutes more. • Remove from heat and stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4). Season with salt and pepper.  Swap in beef for pork.', '• Fluff rice with a fork; stir in lime zest and season with salt and pepper. • Divide rice between bowls and top with pork mixture, veggies, Monterey Jack, salsa, and crema. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side. Ground Beef is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160°.']
