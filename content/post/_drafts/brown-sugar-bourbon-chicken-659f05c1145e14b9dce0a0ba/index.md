description: "Always raising the bar, this week, our chefs amped up pork chop flavors big time! Tender chops are coated in brown sugar bourbon seasoning (which is all kinds of savory-sweet), then cooked and topped with a buttery apple pan sauce. Crispy roasted broccoli and scallion-flecked mashed potatoes pair perfectly with the main event. Winner, winner, pork chop dinner!"

instructions: ['• Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Dice potatoes into ½-inch pieces. Place in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, 15-20 minutes. • Reserve ½ cup potato cooking liquid, then drain and return potatoes to pot. • Keep covered off heat until ready to mash in step 5.', '• While potatoes cook, pat pork* dry with paper towels. Season all over with Brown Sugar Bourbon Seasoning. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes per side. TIP: If the pork begins to brown too quickly, reduce heat to medium. • Turn off heat; transfer pork to a plate. Wipe out pan. Swap in chicken for pork; cook until cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side.', '• While pork cooks, cut broccoli into bite-size pieces if necessary. Toss on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast on middle rack until lightly browned, 15-20 minutes. • Meanwhile, halve, core, and dice apple into ¼-inch pieces. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.', '• Melt 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in pan used for pork over medium-high heat. Add apple and scallion whites; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, 4-6 minutes. • Stir in stock concentrate, ½ cup water (¾ cup for 4), and ½ tsp sugar (1 tsp for 4). Cook until sauce has thickened and apple is tender, 5-7 minutes. • In the last 2 minutes, return pork to pan until warmed through. Season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat. Use pan used for chicken here.', '• Mash potatoes until mostly smooth. • Stir in scallion greens, sour cream, 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings), and a splash of reserved potato cooking liquid. Season with salt and pepper. TIP: If needed, add more potato cooking liquid a splash at a time until potatoes are smooth and creamy.', '• Divide pork, mashed potatoes, and broccoli between plates. Top pork with apple pan sauce and serve. Chicken is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 165°.']
