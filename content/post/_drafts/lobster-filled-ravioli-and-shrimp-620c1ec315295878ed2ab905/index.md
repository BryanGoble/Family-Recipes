title: 'Lobster-Filled Ravioli & Shrimp'
description: "When tender ravioli are packed with fresh lobster and pillowy ricotta, then topped with succulent, seared shrimp, we call that a crustacean celebration! This divine dish is kicked up a notch with zucchini ribbons, a lemony cream sauce, and a sprinkle of Parmesan and fresh lemon zest. We won’t call you shellfish for licking the plate clean."

ingredients: ['2 unit Scallions', '1 unit Lemon', '1 unit Zucchini', '10 ounce Shrimp', '2 tablespoon Cream Cheese', '2 tablespoon Sour Cream', '9 ounce Lobster Ravioli', '¼ cup Parmesan Cheese', '1 teaspoon Chili Flakes', '2 teaspoon Olive Oil', '5 tablespoon Butter', ' Salt', ' Pepper', '2 teaspoon Cooking Oil']

instructionTitles: ['Prep', 'Cook Shrimp', 'Start Sauce', 'Cook Pasta', 'Finish Sauce & Pasta', 'Serve']
instructions: ['• Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. • Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Zest and quarter lemon. Trim ends from zucchini. Shave zucchini lengthwise into ribbons using a peeler, rotating as you go, until you get to the seedy core; discard core.', '• Rinse shrimp* under cold water, then pat dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper. • Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until opaque and cooked through, 3-4 minutes. • Turn off heat; transfer shrimp to a plate and set aside. Wipe out pan.', '• Heat 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) and a large drizzle of olive oil in same pan over low heat. Add scallion whites and cook, stirring, until softened, 1-2 minutes. • Turn off heat; stir in cream cheese and sour cream until smooth.', '• Once water is boiling, add ravioli to pot and reduce heat to low. Cook until ravioli are tender and floating to the top, 3-4 minutes. • Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water, then gently drain or use a slotted spoon to remove ravioli from pot.', '• Return pan with sauce to low heat. Stir in 1⁄3 cup reserved pasta cooking water (½ cup for 4 servings) and juice from half the lemon (whole lemon for 4). • Add 2 TBSP butter; stir constantly until melted. Repeat with another 2 TBSP butter; cook until sauce is creamy, 2-3 minutes. TIP: If sauce seems too thick, stir in more pasta cooking water a splash at a time. • Gently stir in shrimp and zucchini ribbons; cook until zucchini is tender, 1-2 minutes. Add drained ravioli and stir to coat. • Turn off heat. Season with salt and pepper.', '• Divide ravioli mixture between plates. Sprinkle with Parmesan, scallion greens, and as much lemon zest and chili flakes as you like. Serve with any remaining lemon wedges on the side.']
