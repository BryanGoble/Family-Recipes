instructions: ['• Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Trim green beans if necessary. Core, deseed, and dice bell pepper into ½-inch pieces. Halve, peel, and dice onion into ½-inch pieces. Roughly chop parsley.', '• In a small pot, combine rice, seafood stock concentrates, ¾ cup water, and a pinch of salt (use a medium pot and 1½ cups water for 4 servings). • Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to use in Step 6.', '• While rice cooks, toss green beans on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. • Roast on top rack until tender and browned, 12-15 minutes.', '• While green beans roast, pat steak* dry with paper towels and season generously all over with half the Cajun Spice Blend (you’ll use the rest later), salt, and pepper. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook to desired doneness, 5-7 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and tent with foil until ready to serve. TIP: If steak is browning too quickly, lower heat and cover pan. • Let pan cool slightly.', '• Return pan used for steak to medium heat; whisk in chicken stock concentrate, mustard, and 1⁄3 cup water (2⁄3 cup for 4 servings). • Bring to a simmer and cook, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, until sauce has thickened, 1-2 minutes. • Remove from heat; whisk in sour cream until completely blended. Taste and season with salt and pepper if desired. Transfer to a small microwave-safe bowl. Wash out pan.', '• Once rice is done cooking, rinse shrimp* under cold water, then pat dry with paper towels. Season all over with remaining Cajun Spice Blend, salt, and pepper. • Heat a large drizzle of oil in pan used for steak over high heat. Once pan is hot, add shrimp, bell pepper, and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until veggies are tender and shrimp are opaque and cooked through, 5-7 minutes. • Add cooked rice and parsley to pan and cook, stirring constantly, until everything is well combined, 1-2 minutes. (For 4 servings, cook shrimp and veggies in batches, then mix everything together in a large bowl.)', '• Thinly slice steak against the grain. • Divide dirty rice, green beans, and steak between plates in separate sections. Top steak with pan sauce and serve. TIP: If needed, reheat sauce in the microwave for 30 seconds. Steak is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 145°. Shrimp are fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 145°.']
