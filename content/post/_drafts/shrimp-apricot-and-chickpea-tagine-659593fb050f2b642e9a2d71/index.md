title: 'Shrimp, Apricot & Chickpea Tagine'
description: "Tagine is named for the conical clay vessel it’s traditionally cooked in, but you don’t need one to make this dish! Here, our riff on the dish celebrates hearty veggies, fragrant spices, sweet apricots, and crunchy almonds (and swaps the usual couscous for fluffy basmati rice). On top, there’s two flavorful sauces: lemon cream and chermoula. The chermoula is chock-full of parsley, garlic, olive oil, lemon, and jalapeño, which adds the perfect punch. The best part? All you need is 30 minutes for this awesome dish to land on your table."

instructions: ['• Wash and dry produce. • Halve, peel, and dice onion. Mince parsley. Peel and mince or grate garlic. Zest and halve lemon. Mince jalapeño, removing ribs and seeds for less heat. Trim and halve zucchini lengthwise; cut crosswise into ½-inch-thick half-moons. Drain and rinse chickpeas.', '• Heat a drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add ¼ of the onion; cook, stirring, until just softened, 2-3 minutes. • Stir in rice, ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4 servings), half the stock concentrates, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve. Rinse shrimp under cold water. Pat shrimp or chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Once pan is hot, add shrimp or chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Turn off heat; transfer to a plate. Wipe out pan.', '• While rice cooks, in a small bowl, combine parsley, 2 TBSP olive oil (3 TBSP for 4 servings), a pinch of garlic, salt, and pepper. Add lemon juice to taste and as much jalapeño as you like. Taste and add more garlic if desired. • In a separate small bowl, combine sour cream, a pinch of salt, and as much lemon zest as you like. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.', '• Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add zucchini and remaining onion. Cook, stirring, until softened and lightly browned, 5-7 minutes (7-10 minutes for 4 servings). • Add Tunisian Spice Blend, remaining garlic, and a big pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Use pan used for shrimp or chicken here.', '• Add 1⁄3 cup water (2⁄3 cup for 4 servings) and remaining stock concentrate to pan with veggies. • Stir in chickpeas and bring tagine to a low simmer. Cook until liquid has slightly reduced, 1-2 minutes. • Reduce heat to low; stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4) until melted. Season with salt and pepper.', '• Fluff rice with a fork; stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings). Season with salt and pepper. • Divide rice between plates and top with tagine, almonds, and apricots. (TIP: Toast almonds before adding if you like.) Drizzle with lemon crema and chermoula. Drizzle with hot sauce if desired. Cut any remaining lemon into wedges and serve on the side. Serve shrimp or chicken atop rice. Shrimp are fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 145°.']
