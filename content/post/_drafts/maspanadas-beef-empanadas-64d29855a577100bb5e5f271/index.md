title: 'Maspanadas Beef Empanadas'
description: "Flaky, savory, and filled with seasoned ground beef and veggies, these Latin-American pastries are the perfect appetizer or snack for any mealtime or gathering. Colombian-born Margarita Womack and husband Andy were searching for delicious, family-friendly food solutions and launched Maspanadas to help them (and you) make authentic food that fuels life in the fast lane. All you have to do is bake or air fry the empanadas to golden perfection and share! We like to dip them in sour cream and salsa, but feel free to serve with your favorite dips and toppings."
