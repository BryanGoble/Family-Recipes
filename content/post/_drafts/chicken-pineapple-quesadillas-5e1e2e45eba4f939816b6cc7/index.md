title: 'Chicken Pineapple Quesadillas'
description: "If you think sweet-and-savory combos are amazing, prepare to be blown away by this Tex-Mex creation. Chicken, Monterey Jack, and pepper jack (you read that right: 2 cheeses!) bring the classic comforts you crave, while our Southwest spice blend adds some smoky warmth. But any notions you might have about quesadillas go out the window when the pineapple comes to shake things up in the most delicious way"
