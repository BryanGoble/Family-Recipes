title: 'Adobo Loco Steak'
description: "Are you as loco for adobo as we are? If not, it’s time to get on board. The chipotle-based, Mexican-style ingredient is used to flavor a creamy sauce that’s drizzled onto steak in this HelloFresh Hall of Fame recipe. It makes the meat pop and provides a deep, smoky contrast to the brightness of the potato poblano hash. The flavors are so sabroso that they’ll bring some better-than-so-so mojo to your plate."
