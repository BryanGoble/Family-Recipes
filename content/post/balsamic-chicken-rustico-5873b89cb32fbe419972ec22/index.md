title: 'Balsamic Chicken Rustico'
description: "We love a good glaze on our meat. In fact, we love it so much that sometimes we find ourselves slathering that glaze all over our veggies, too. Which is why we came up with this recipe. The chicken breasts aren’t the only things getting coated in a sticky and sweet balsamic sauce. The onions and tomatoes also go for a roast in it, soaking in all that vinegar-kissed flavor as they cook in the oven."
