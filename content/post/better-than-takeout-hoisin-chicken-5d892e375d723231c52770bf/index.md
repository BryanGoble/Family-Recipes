instructions: ['Wash and dry all produce (except green beans). In a small pot, combine rice, ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4 servings), and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.', 'Meanwhile, trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Peel and mince ginger. Thinly slice chili, removing seeds for less heat. In a small bowl, combine hoisin, sriracha, honey, and 2 TBSP water (3 TBSP for 4 servings).', 'Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes.', 'While chicken cooks, pierce green bean bag with a fork; place bag on a plate. Microwave until tender, 1-2 minutes. Carefully remove green beans from bag and transfer to a large bowl; toss with 1 TBSP butter, salt, and pepper until evenly coated. > TIP: No microwave? No problem! Steam beans in a small pot with a splash of water until just tender, 5-7 minutes.', 'Once chicken is cooked through, add scallion whites and ginger to pan. Cook until fragrant, 30-60 seconds, then pour in sauce. Cook until sauce has thickened and coats chicken, 2-3 minutes. Turn off heat.', 'Fluff rice with a fork and season with salt and pepper. Divide rice, green beans, and chicken between plates. Garnish with scallion greens, sesame seeds, and chili to taste.']
