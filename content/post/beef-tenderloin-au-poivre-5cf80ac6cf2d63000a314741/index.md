title: 'Beef Tenderloin Au Poivre'
description: "Au Poivre is a staple on french bistro menus for a reason, it’s delicious! This dish may sound fancy but It’s simply a peppercorn crusted steak that is seared, creating a delicious zingy crust that pairs perfectly with the juicy meat. Then it's topped with an elegant peppery sauce that is rich with flavor from our demi-glace and finished with butter. Served with golden potato wedges and roasted green beans, it's a complete elegant meal. Bonus points for making you feel like you just landed in Pari!"
