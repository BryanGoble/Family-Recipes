title: "Za'atar-Crusted Grilling Cheese"
description: "Did you ever think that you could grill cheese? We’re not talking about sandwiches but about throwing a big hunk of cheese directly onto the heat so the outsides get beautifully charred while the insides get warm and melty. It took us by surprise, but by golly, it’s tasty. To make it, you’ll dredge the cheese in za’atar, a Middle Eastern herb blend, then serve it on top of bubbly couscous and tender zucchini and onion dusted in tangy sumac."
