ingredients: ['4 ounce Bacon', '1 unit Onion', '1 clove Garlic', '10 ounce Chopped Chicken Breast', '4 tablespoon BBQ Sauce', '2 unit Flatbreads', '1 cup Mozzarella Cheese', '1.5 ounce Buttermilk Ranch Dressing', ' Salt', ' Pepper']

instructionTitles: ['Cook Bacon', 'Prep', 'Cook Chicken & Toast Flatbread', 'Finish & Serve']
instructions: ['• Adjust rack to top position (top and middle positions for 4 servings) and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry produce. • Heat a large dry pan over medium-high heat. Add bacon*; cook, turning occasionally and adjusting heat if browning too quickly, until crispy, 6-10 minutes. Turn off heat; transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. Carefully discard all but a thin layer of bacon fat from the pan (you’ll use it in Step 3). • Once bacon is cool enough to handle, roughly chop.', '• Meanwhile, halve, peel, and thinly slice onion. Mince garlic.', '• Open package of chicken* and drain off any excess liquid. • Heat pan with reserved bacon fat over medium-low heat. Add chicken and onion in a single layer; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. In the last minute of cooking, stir in garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant. • Remove pan from heat. Stir in BBQ sauce and a splash of water (we used 2-3 TBSP; 4-6 TBSP for 4 servings) until chicken is coated. • Meanwhile, place flatbreads on a baking sheet. Toast on top rack until golden, 3-4 minutes. (For 4, divide flatbreads between two sheets. Toast on top and middle racks, swapping rack positions halfway through.) > TIP: If there isn’t enough bacon fat, add a drizzle of oil. > Bacon is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 145°. > Chicken is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 165°.', '• Evenly sprinkle flatbreads with mozzarella; top with chicken mixture and bacon. • Return to top rack until cheese melts, 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and slice each flatbread into quarters. • Divide flatbreads between plates. Drizzle with ranch dressing and serve.']
