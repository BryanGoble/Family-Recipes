description: "There are few things more satisfying than steak for dinner. Until now! These beefy bowls are hearty, filling, and most of all—absolutely delicious. There’s tender steak simmered with garlic and soy sauce piled atop fluffy white rice along with a pickley cucumber salad and lime-spiked sriracha mayo. For a finishing touch, everything is sprinkled with chopped peanuts. One bite will have you totally bowled over."
