title: 'Chicken and Guac Burrito Bowls'
description: "Bowls are way past “having a moment.” They’ve become a pillar of our lunches and dinners. Why? It’s simple: everything’s better in a bowl! (Nice knowing you, plates.) But seriously, the customizable combo of carbs, protein, veggies, and a drizzle of delicious sauce cannot be denied. True to form, this Mexican-inspired rendition is fully loaded. Steamy lime rice is topped with spiced chicken, fresh salsa, a tangle of veggies, hot sauce-spiked crema, and of course, a big dollop of guacamole. In our bowl, though, guac is never extra."

instructions: ['Wash and dry all produce. Core and deseed, and slice green pepper crosswise into thin strips. Halve, peel, and thinly slice shallot; mince a few slices until you have 2 tsp (4 tsp for 4 servings). In a medium pot, combine rice and 1¼ cups salted water (2¼ cups for 4 serving); bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Turn off heat. Keep covered until ready to serve.', 'Meanwhile, finely dice tomato. Zest and quarter lime (quarter both limes for 4 servings). In a small bowl, combine tomato, minced shallot, and juice from 2 lime wedges (4 wedges for 4). Season with salt and pepper.', 'In a second small bowl, combine sour cream and hot sauce (to taste). Add water, 1 tsp at a time, until it reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt.', 'Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add green pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to soften, about 6 minutes. Stir in sliced shallot, half the Southwest Spice (you’ll use the rest later), salt, and pepper. Cook until veggies are softened and beginning to brown, about 2 minutes more. Turn off heat. Transfer to a plate and loosely cover with foil to keep warm. Wipe out pan.', 'Meanwhile, pat chicken dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper, then rub to evenly coat with remaining Southwest Spice. Heat a large drizzle of oil in pan used for veggies over medium-high heat.

Slice chicken crosswise.', 'Fluff rice with a fork, then stir in lime zest, 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings), salt, and pepper. Divide rice between bowls. Top with chicken, veggies, guacamole, cheese, and salsa fresca. Drizzle with crema and any remaining hot sauce, if desired. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.']
