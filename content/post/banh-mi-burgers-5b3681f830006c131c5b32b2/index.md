Set aside.', 'In a medium bowl, combine pork, lemongrass, lime zest, shallot, 1 TBSP soy sauce (we sent more), half the mint, Thai seasoning, and remaining sriracha (to taste). Season with salt and pepper. Shape mixture into two evenly sized patties with your hands (they should be slightly wider than the buns).', 'Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add patties to pan and cook until browned and no longer pink in center, 4-5 minutes per side. Meanwhile, split buns in half and place on another baking sheet.
