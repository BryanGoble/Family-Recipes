## Ingredients
  - 2 Tbsp Olive Oil
  - 2 lbs Lean Ground beef
  - 1 large yellow onion (diced)
  - 3 cloves minced garlic
  - 1 cup low sodium beef broth
  - 2 15 oz cans tomato sauce
  - 2 tsp low sodium soy sauce

## Instructions

### Prep & Make Slaw
- Wash and dry produce.
- Roughly chop cilantro. Halve, core, and thinly slice green pepper.
- In a medium bowl, toss together coleslaw mix, half the vinegar (all for 4 servings), half the cilantro, 1 tsp sugar (2 tsp for 4), and a pinch of salt until thoroughly combined.

### Cook Pepper & Pork
- Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add green pepper and cook until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes.
- Add pork* and season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes.
- Stir in sweet soy glaze; cook until everything is coated and glaze has thickened, 1-2 minutes. Remove pan from heat.

> Swap in beef for pork, if desired.

> Ground Beef is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160Â°.

### Mix Mayo & Warm Tortillas
- Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine mayonnaise with Sriracha to taste. Season with salt and pepper.
- Wrap tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave until warm and pliable, 30 seconds.

### Serve
- Divide tortillas between plates and fill with pork mixture and slaw (draining first). Top with Sriracha mayo, crispy fried onions, and remaining cilantro. Serve.
